Lorem Ipsum has been the industry&#x27;s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div style=\"text-align: center;margin-top:30px\">\r\n                                    <strong>Contact details:</strong>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <table style=\"width: 100%;

Lorem Ipsum has been the industry&#x27;s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div style=\"text-align: center;margin-top:30px\">\r\n                                    <strong>Contact details:</strong>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <table style=\"width: 100%;

In per capita terms, it is perhaps the most multilingual community in the world. The linguistic variety is echoed by the cultural diversity in the area, evidenced by the number of different religious ceremonies and the multitude of artistic forms in design, music and dance. People speak Ndjébbana, eastern Kunwinjku, Kune, Rembarrnga, Dangbon/Dalabon, Nakkara, Gurrgoni, Djinang, Wurlaki, Ganalbingu, Gupapuyngu, Kunbarlang, Gun-nartpa, Burarra, and English. Most people have command of at least three of these languages.\r\nOn the night of 24 April 2006 Cyclone Monica, the most severe cyclone ever to strike Australia, passed just to the west of the community. Fortunately the community was spared the full brute force of the category 5 cyclone and infrastructure damage was only light to moderate.\r\nCoordinates: 12°03′S 134°13′E﻿ / ﻿12.050°S 134.217°E﻿ / -12.050; 134.217\r\nManingrida is an indigenous community in the heart of the Arnhem Land region of Australia\'s Northern Territory. Maningrida is 500 km (311 mi) east of Darwin,[1] and 300 km (186 mi) north east of Jabiru. At the 2006 census, Maningrida had a population of 2,068.[2]\r\nThe township of Maningrida dates back to just after World War 2. Syd Kyle-Little, working for the newly formed Native Affairs Department, came up with the plan of a trading post to create a self-sufficient Aboriginal community, where the trading post became the central meeting point attracting tribes from the interior and surrounding coastal regions. A successful trading post was to stop the drift of Aboriginal people leaving their homelands and moving to Darwin. Its success would make Maningrida independent and not having to rely on welfare. Jack Doolan became Syd\'s cadet patrol officer and together they made the first white contact with the Aboriginal tribes since a hostile encounter with Mathew Flinders on his circumnavigation of Australia. This was converted by Dave and Ingrid Drysdale into a permanent Welfare Department settlement from 1957, partly to quell the post-war migration of Aboriginal people from the Blyth and Liverpool Rivers regions into Darwin. Patrols went out to spread the word and encourage people to move into the settlement. Within a few years, many people from the surrounding area were living in Maningrida.\r\nClose to Maningrida is Haul Round Island which has been identified as an Important Bird Area because of its seabird breeding colony - one of the largest in the Northern Territory. The seabird eggs, mainly those of roseate and bridled terns, are often harvested as a food resource.[5]\r\nIt is on the North Central Arnhem Land coast of the Arafura Sea, on the estuary of the Liverpool River. The Kunibídji people are the traditional landowners of this country. The name Maningrida is an Anglicised version of the Kunibídji name Manayingkarírra, which comes from the phrase Mane djang karirra, meaning \"the place where the Dreaming changed shape.\"\"\"\"[3] The town supports a population of 2\"',0,-12.086972,134.271016),(45,'Marrakai','822','Darwin Suburbs','Darwin','NT','Not yet populated',0,-12.361331,130.876795),(46,'Mcminns Lagoon','822','Darwin Suburbs','Darwin','NT','Not yet populated',0,-12.542204,131.079417),(47,'Middle Point','822','Darwin Suburbs','Darwin','NT','Not yet populated',0,-12.646157,131.015033),(48,'Milikapiti','822','Darwin Suburbs','Darwin','NT','Not yet populated',0,-12.411749,130.948361),(49,'Nguiu','822','Darwin Suburbs','Darwin','NT','Not yet populated',0,-11.764711,130.314401),(50,'Oenpelli','822','Darwin Suburbs','Darwin','NT','Not yet populated',0,-12.414984,132.987357),(51,'Point Stephens','822','Darwin Suburbs','Darwin','NT','Not yet populated',0,-23.721252,133.884318),(52,'Pularumpi','822','Darwin Suburbs','Darwin','NT','Not yet populated',0,-12.447299,131.004516),(53,'Southport','822','Darwin Suburbs','Darwin','NT','Not yet populated',0,-12.742355,130.956082),(54,'Umbakumba','822','Darwin Suburbs','Darwin','NT','Not yet populated',0,-13.848676,136.428043),(55,'Wadeye','822','Darwin Suburbs','Darwin','NT','Wadeye is a town in Australia\'s Northern Territory. Pronounced wod-air-yer, it was formerly known (and is still often referred to) as Port Keats. At the 2006 census, Wadeye had a population of 1,627.[1]\r\nNym Bundak was the first painter in Wadeye who had international interest. He was asked by Bill Stanner, an anthropologist who had come with Richard Docherty in 1935, to produce pieces explaining traditional law, which he made after he saw a map produced by Stanner. He produced many bark paintings of the dreaming which informed Stanner\'s research. Today in Wadeye Mark Crocomb follows in the footsteps of Stanner collecting history and languages before they are lost. Following in the tradition of Nym Bundak is Richard \'Skunky\' Parmbuk. He is one of many artists filling the space left by Nym in Wadeye.[5][6]\r\nWadeye is mainly inhabited by Indigenous Australians. The inhabitants include seven language groups, the main language that is spoken being Murrinhpatha. The indigenous population has five traditional bands or kinship groups of Nangiomeri, Marimanindji, Marithiel, Maringar and Mulluk Mulluk. Port Keats is also the site of a temporary ADF Radar site that is used during exercises conducted in the Top End.\r\nA mission station was founded by Roman Catholic Father Richard Docherty in 1935 at Werntek Nganayi (Old Mission), and subsequently moved to a new location with superior water, gardening and building sites and landing place.[3]\r\nThe town is remote, situated on the western edge of the Daly River Reserve about 230 km by air south-west of Darwin. It lies close to the Hyland Bay and Moyle Floodplain Important Bird Area, identified as such by BirdLife International because of its importance for large numbers of waterbirds.[2] Roads to the community are cut by flooding during the wet season, when access is only possible by light aircraft or coastal barge.\r\nSince 2007 violence between the Judas Priest and Evil Warriors gangs has declined.[4]',0,-14.174070,130.138330),(56,'Wagait Beach','822','Darwin Suburbs','Darwin','NT','Not yet populated',0,-12.433507,130.748017),(57,'Weddell','822','Darwin Suburbs','Darwin','NT','Not yet populated',0,-12.434023,130.841120),(58,'Woolaning','822','Darwin Suburbs','Darwin','NT','Not yet populated',0,-12.419838,130.949418),(59,'Berrimah','828','Darwin Suburbs','Darwin','NT','Not yet populated',0,-12.474896,130.907378),(60,'Knuckey Lagoon','828','Darwin Suburbs','Darwin','NT','Not yet populated',0,-12.426825,130.934141),(61,'Holtze','829','Darwin Suburbs','Darwin','NT','Not yet populated',0,-14.460879,132.280002),(62,'Driver','830','Litchfield','Darwin','NT','Not yet populated',0,-12.487233,130.972637),(63,'Durack','830','Litchfield','Darwin','NT','Not yet populated',0,-12.193006,136.763961),(64,'Farrar','830','Litchfield','Darwin','NT','Not yet populated',0,-12.480219,130.997607),(65,'Gray','830','Litchfield','Darwin','NT','Not yet populated',0,-12.384847,130.872981),(66,'Marlow Lagoon','830','Litchfield','Darwin','NT','Not yet populated',0,-12.446554,130.923435),(67,'Moulden','830','Litchfield','Darwin','NT','Not yet populated',0,-12.511316,130.974467),(68,'Palmerston','830','Litchfield','Darwin','NT','Not yet populated',0,-12.480066,130.984006),(69,'Shoal Bay','830','Litchfield','Darwin','NT','Not yet populated',0,-12.394902,130.924268),(70,'Woodroffe','830','Litchfield','Darwin','NT','Not yet populated',0,-12.504958,130.981903),(71,'Yarrawonga','830','Litchfield','Darwin','NT','Not yet populated',0,-12.471149,130.984917),(72,'Gunn','832','Litchfield','Darwin','NT','Not yet populated',0,-12.492269,130.990891),(73,'Mitchell','832','Litchfield','Darwin','NT','Not yet populated',0,-12.460386,130.837001),(74,'Timboon West','3268','Colac - Corangamite','Warrnambool and South West','VIC','Not yet populated',0,-38.505198,142.914428),(75,'Thorpdale South','3824','Baw Baw','Latrobe - Gippsland','VIC','Not yet populated',0,-38.331875,146.118691),(76,'Howard Springs','835','Litchfield','Darwin','NT','Not yet populated',0,-12.481380,131.029173),(77,'Virginia','835','Litchfield','Darwin','NT','Not yet populated',0,-12.545626,131.029268),(78,'Girraween','836','Litchfield','Darwin','NT','Not yet populated',0,-12.525546,131.103025),(79,'Herbert','836','Litchfield','Darwin','NT','Not yet populated',0,-14.462901,132.280885),(80,'Manton','837','Litchfield','Darwin','NT','Not yet populated',0,-12.460094,130.842663),(81,'Berry Springs','838','Litchfield','Darwin','NT','Not yet populated',0,-12.709507,130.995407),(82,'Dundee Beach','840','Daly - Tiwi - West Arnhem','Northern Territory - Outback','NT','Not yet populated',0,-12.717562,130.351316),(83,'Dundee Downs','840','Daly - Tiwi - West Arnhem','Northern Territory - Outback','NT','Not yet populated',0,-12.771275,130.527516),(84,'Dundee Forest','840','Daly - Tiwi - West Arnhem','Northern Territory - Outback','NT','Not yet populated',0,-12.749956,130.524993),(85,'Thorpdale','3835','Baw Baw','Latrobe - Gippsland','VIC','Not yet populated',0,-38.331875,146.118691),(86,'Batchelor','845','Daly - Tiwi - West Arnhem','Northern Territory - Outback','NT','Not yet populated',0,-13.038663,131.072091),(88,'Pine Creek','847','Daly - Tiwi - West Arnhem','Northern Territory - Outback','NT','The Territory\'s first tin mine commenced operations near Pine Creek in 1878, but was soon eclipsed by the deposits at Maranboy.[6]\r\nThe Eleanor Reef at Pine Creek was discovered in 1880, some 9 years before the railway reached the town. The Jensen Gold Mining Co. established a mine on the reef about a mile from the southern boundary of the Pine Creek Railway reserve. A battery was built in 1893 to crush ore from the Eleanor and another reef and, concurrently, they ordered tramway materials from England. The tramway was operational by 1895. The tramway was still in place in 1912 when surveyors plotted the route of the extension of the North Australia Railway from Pine Creek to Katherine, but was abandoned by 1914 when construction teams arrived. The locomotive was moved to the Maranboy Tin mines in 1916.[7]\r\nPine Creek was traditionally the junction of three large indigenous ethnic groups. Stretching south-west from the Stuart Highway towards, and across, the Daly River was the land traditionally associated with the Wagiman people. The land east of the Stuart Highway and south of the Kakadu Highway, stretching to Katherine, was associated with the Jawoyn people, and north of the Kakadu Highway was land traditionally associated with Waray.\r\nDuring construction of the Overland Telegraph line from Adelaide to Darwin in 1870, workers first crossed a creek that was notable for the pine trees that grew on its banks. In 1871 workers digging holes for the telegraph line found gold in the soil, triggering another Australian gold rush.[a][b][c] The town grew rapidly with the influx of miners, many of whom were Chinese immigrants brought into the Territory from 1874 as a source of cheap labour.[2] By 1873, a telegraph repeater station and police camp had been established. By 1875 there were two hotels, The Royal Mail and The Standard, competing for business.[3] A public school opened in the town in 1899.[4] By the 1890s, up to 15 mines were operating in the area, and the town\'s population exceeded 3000 people.[5]\r\nDuring World War II, the Australian Army set up 65th Australian Camp Hospital near Pine Creek. An airfield was constructed between May and July 1942 by the US Army 808th Engineer Aviation Battalion as an emergency landing ground and to serve the military units based in the town. Unlike many Top End towns, Pine Creek was not bombed by the Japanese during the war, although Japanese reconnaissance aircraft are reported to have overflown the town on at least one occasion.[11]\r\nThe first stage of the North Australia Railway was built between Port Darwin and Pine Creek reaching the town in 1889. Additional sidings were added to the rail yards in 1914 in preparation for the extension of the line south to Emungalan (Katherine) which opened in 1917.[8] A poorly maintained unsealed road was constructed in the 1930s, following the railway line from Adelaide River to Larrimah, passing through Pine Creek. Much of this track would later become the Stuart Highway.[9]\r\nIt was also during the war years that sealed, all weather sections of the Stuart Highway were constructed, providing transport alternatives to the railway. Work on the road was completed in this area by 1944.[9]\r\nPine Creek is a small town in the Katherine region of the Northern Territory, Australia. According to the 2001 Australian census 665 people live in Pine Creek, which is the fourth largest town between Darwin and Alice Springs.\r\nPine Creek Goldfields Limited opened an open-cut gold mine in the region in 1985; however, the mine is now closed and its main pit, the Enterprise Pit, has been carefully filled with water to prevent acid build-up.\r\nThis line would close in 1976. The old railway station (1888) and some rolling stock remain, including locomotive NF2, built in 1877 which was restored to operational condition in 2001.[10] The Adelaide-Darwin railway (used by The Ghan) now passes near the town.\r\nPine Creek is just off the Stuart Highway (the road from the south to Darwin) and is still a notable tourist stop. A number of events are held each year to promote the town in the region. These include the annual Goldrush Festival, featuring the NT Gold Panning championships and Didgeridoo Jam, the Pine Creek Rodeo and Pine Creek Races. In 2005 a prominent resident of Pine Creek, Edward Ah Toy, was recognised as the Northern Territorian of the year.\r\nIn June 2007, Territory Resources (trading under the name Territory Iron) commenced mining iron ore at their Frances Creek mine 58 km north of Pine Creek 1 km from Frances Creek itself and 500mtrs from Lake View.[12] This iron ore was previously mined between 1967 and 1974, and consists of haematite with some goethite and limonite.[13] In October 2014 it was used in an episode of filming for the UK television programme Top Gear.[14]',0,-13.824123,131.835799),(90,'Beswick','852','Kimberley','Western Australia - Outback (North)','NT','Not yet populated',0,-14.922670,133.064654),(92,'Lajamanu','852','Kimberley','Western Australia - Outback (North)','NT','Not yet populated',0,-19.141443,130.051529),(93,'Larrimah','852','Kimberley','Western Australia - Outback (North)','NT','Not yet populated',0,-15.627120,132.944488),(94,'Manbulloo','852','Kimberley','Western Australia - Outback (North)','NT','Not yet populated',0,-12.360929,130.880316),(95,'Numbulwar','852','Kimberley','Western Australia - Outback (North)','NT','Not yet populated',0,-14.654030,134.781670),(96,'Wave Hill','852','Kimberley','Western Australia - Outback (North)','NT','Not yet populated',0,-17.450131,130.103437),(97,'Borroloola','854','Katherine','Northern Territory - Outback','NT','Not yet populated',0,-16.818390,137.147070),(98,'Tennant Creek','860','Barkly','Northern Territory - Outback','NT','The Barkly Tableland runs east from Tennant Creek towards the Queensland border and is among the most important cattle grazing areas in the Northern Territory. Roughly the same size as the United Kingdom or New Zealand, the region consists largely of open grass plains and some of the world’s largest cattle stations. It runs as far south as Barrow Creek, north above Elliott and west into the Tanami Desert.\r\nTennant Creek is a town located in the Northern Territory of Australia. It is the fifth largest town in the Northern Territory and it is located on the Stuart Highway, just south of the intersection with the western terminus of the Barkly Highway. At the 2011 census, Tennant Creek had a population of 3,062.[1] The postcode of Tennant Creek is 0860.\r\nThe total population of Tennant Creek is approximately 3000, of which around 1500 are Aboriginal. Tennant Creek is a multicultural community, with residents from Britain, New Zealand, Ireland, the Philippines, Thailand, India, Bosnia and Germany as well as Australia.\r\nTennant Creek is approximately 1,000 kilometres south of the territory capital, Darwin, and 500 kilometres north of Alice Springs. The town is named after a nearby watercourse of the same name. At the 2001 census, Tennant Creek had a population of 3,185, of which 1,176 identified themselves as indigenous.[2] Tennant Creek is near well-known attractions including the Devils Marbles, Mary Ann Dam, Battery Hill Mining Centre and the Nyinkka Nyunyu Culture Centre and is the hub of the sprawling Barkly Tableland, vast elevated plains of black soil with golden Mitchell grass, that cover more than 240,000 square kilometres.\r\nAnother important contributor to Tennant life was Mrs Weaber, wife of the blind owner of the Rising Sun Mine, one the richest gold mines in the district before World War II. A devout Catholic, Mrs Weaber paid for the old church at Pine Creek to be transported to Tennant Creek plank by wooden plank. This beautiful building can still be found in Tennant Creek today. Mrs Weaber also started the Tennant Creek Christmas tree event when, in the early 1930s she held a party at her husband\'s gold mine and gave every child on the gold field a present. Mrs Weaber\'s generosity continues into the present day. Every year the town erects a public Christmas tree and every child, local or visitor, is given a present. The Weaber family left Tennant Creek in 1940 following a series of personal family tragedies. They sold the lease to what would become Tennant\'s richest post war mine, Nobles Nob, before they realised its potential.[10] Nobles Nob was named after Jack Noble, an old friend of the Weaber family from the days when they all lived in the Kimberley Region of Western Australia.\r\nMary Ann Dam is a popular recreation spot, easily accessible from town by road or bicycle track and popular for swimming, barbecues, picnics or bush walks. The area’s best known attraction, Karlu Karlu / Devils Marbles Conservation Reserve is 100 kilometres south of Tennant Creek and is one of the Territory\'s most photographed features. These huge granite boulders are scattered through a wide, shallow valley. The formations provide shelter to a variety of flora and fauna of the area and glow a rich red in the light of the early evening. Local Aboriginal mythology holds that the boulders are the eggs of the Rainbow Serpent.[citation needed] Visitors can take a self-guided walk from the car park. Bush camping facilities are available.\r\nThe Overland Telegraph that once linked Melbourne to London was constructed in the 1870s and forged a corridor through the middle of the continent that the Explorer’s Way and Ghan train now travel. A temporary building for a telegraph repeater station was erected near the watercourse of Tennant Creek in 1872. Two years later, the solid stone buildings of the Tennant Creek Telegraph Station that remain on the site today, were completed by the occupants of the station. This is one of the four remaining original telegraph stations in Australia. Tennant Creek was the site of Australia’s last gold rush during the 1930s and at that time was the third-largest gold producer in Australia. The Tennant Creek Telegraph Station remained an isolated outpost until that time.\r\nThe town of Tennant Creek was located 12 km south of the watercourse because the Overland Telegraph Station had been allocated an 11 km reserve. Local legend offers a different explanation for the town\'s location. In 1934 Joe Kilgarriff from Alice Springs built the Tennant Creek hotel on the eastern side of the telegraph line . The pub still exists and is a historic monument to the early days.\r\nThe town today is situated on a stretch of the Stuart Highway known as Paterson Street. As it is a regional centre, it contains government services and local business and also has a developing tourist centre. There are a number of restaurants and tourist activities to complement its friendly relaxed lifestyle.

The Centre for Appropriate Technology was established in 1980 and provides a range of services to encourage and help Aboriginal people enhance their quality of life in remote communities.\r\nIt was not until alluvial gold was discovered at Arltunga, 100 kilometres (62 mi) east of the present Alice Springs, in 1887 that any significant European settlement occurred.[13] The town\'s first substantial building was the Stuart Town Gaol in Parson\'s Street which was built in 1909 when the town had a European population of fewer than 20 people. Many of the gaol\'s first prisoners were first contact aboriginal men incarcerated for killing cattle.[14] The first aircraft, piloted by Francis Stewart Briggs landed in 1921.[15] Central Australia\'s first hospital, Adelaide House, was built in 1926 when the European population of the town was about 40. It was not until 1929 when the train line to Alice was built, that the town\'s European population began to grow. Aboriginal Centralians outnumbered European Centralians until the mid-1930s.[16] Until 31 August 1933, the town was officially known as Stuart.[17]\r\nThe region around Alice Springs is part of the Central Ranges xeric scrub area of dry scrubby grassland[22] and includes the MacDonnell Ranges which run east and west of the city and contain a number of hiking trails and swimming holes such as Ormiston Gorge, Ormiston Gorge Creek, Red Bank Gorge and Glen Helen Gorge. The 223-kilometre-long (139 mi) Larapinta Trail follows the West MacDonnell Ranges and is considered among the world\'s great walking experiences.\r\nLeisure and entertainment activities include hiking in the nearby MacDonnell Ranges, driving the four-wheel drive tracks at Finke Gorge National Park and visiting the many art galleries in Todd Mall.\r\nEvery year, on the Queen\'s Birthday long weekend, the annual Finke Desert Race is held. It is a gruelling off-road race that runs from Alice Springs to the Finke community, then back again the next day. The total length of the race is roughly 500 kilometres (310 mi). It attracts spectators, who camp along the whole length of the track, and roughly 500 competitors, buggies and bikes, every year, making it the biggest sporting event in the Alice Springs calendar.\r\nThe town has some excellent small museums. The extensive collection at the Old Timer\'s Traeger Museum on the North Stuart Highway includes artefacts from the town\'s early Afghan and German residents, traditional Aboriginal artefacts and objects which show the early fusion of European and Aboriginal cultures like a spinifex-handled glass-bladed knife. An audio tour[53] and educational riddle style activities for children can be downloaded from The Flynn Trail web site.[54] The museum is open from 2pm – 4pm seven days a week.\r\nAlice Springs has many historic buildings including the Overland Telegraph Station, the Old Courthouse and Residency and the Hartley Street School. Adelaide House, a beautiful stone building in the middle of the Mall, Central Australia\'s first hospital, was designed and built by the Rev. John Flynn, founder of the world\'s first flying doctor service, in 1926. It was also the site of the world\'s first successful portable wireless radio experiment conducted by Alf Traeger. Today it is a museum, one of several significant tourist attractions which form part of \'The Flynn Trail\' a self-guided urban heritage trail.[21]\r\nAlice Springs\' population of Aboriginal residents is overrepresented as offenders in violent crimes, accounting for over three quarters of assault offenders.[47][page needed] Assaults are common in Aboriginal town camps and 95 per cent of people in the town fleeing domestic violence are indigenous.[48] The high crime rate is due to conditions in Alice Springs Aboriginal communities[44][48][49][50] and also partly due to Aboriginal people moving into Alice Springs from more remote communities.[49][51] Crime rates in Alice Springs Aboriginal communities reached crisis point in 2013, leading to the local government called an emergency meeting of Territory government, police and other stakeholders.[52]\r\nSince 2013 the population of Alice Springs has declined.[1] The population estimate for June 2015 of 27,972 was a decline of 1 percent on 2014.[1] The five-year average rate of growth until June 2015 was negative 0.3 percent year-on-year.[1] In 2006, the largest ancestry groups in the Alice Springs were Australian (9,814 or 31.4%), English (6,970 or 22.3%), Irish (2,217 or 7.1%), Scottish (1,825 or 7.1%), Australian Aboriginal (1,790 or 5.7%, although note that a far greater proportion of the town\'s residents identify as Aboriginal), German (1,502 or 4.8%), and Italian (529 or 1.7%).[29] Although 74.7% of Alice Springs\' population was born in Australia, the most common places of birth for immigrants in 2006 Census were the United Kingdom (3.4%), United States of America (3%), New Zealan',0,-12.436101,130.840590),(110,'Ali Curung','872','Eyre Peninsula and South West','South Australia - Outback','NT','Not yet populated',0,-20.998545,134.382200),(111,'Amata','872','Eyre Peninsula and South West','South Australia - Outback','NT','Not yet populated',0,-25.962716,131.606872),(112,'Amoonguna','872','Eyre Peninsula and South West','South Australia - Outback','NT','Not yet populated',0,-23.747506,133.926632),(113,'Areyonga','872','Eyre Peninsula and South West','South Australia - Outback','NT','Not yet populated',0,-24.166937,132.286759),(114,'Erldunda','872','Eyre Peninsula and South West','South Australia - Outback','NT','Not yet populated',0,-12.364467,130.876251),(115,'Finke','872','Eyre Peninsula and South West','South Australia - Outback','NT','Not yet populated',0,-25.698005,134.339708),(116,'Gibson Desert North','872','Eyre Peninsula and South West','South Australia - Outback','WA','Not yet populated',0,-22.590927,125.664556),(117,'Haasts Bluff','872','Eyre Peninsula and South West','South Australia - Outback','NT','Not yet populated',0,-23.509293,132.185203),(119,'Santa Teresa','872','Eyre Peninsula and South West','South Australia - Outback','NT','Not yet populated',0,-24.730598,135.332238),(120,'Ti Tree','872','Eyre Peninsula and South West','South Australia - Outback','NT','Not yet populated',0,-12.477758,131.068332),(121,'Uluru','872','Eyre Peninsula and South West','South Australia - Outback','NT','Not yet populated',0,-12.486152,130.992541),(122,'Willowra','872','Eyre Peninsula and South West','South Australia - Outback','NT','Not yet populated',0,-21.717344,133.030085),(123,'Yuelamu','872','Eyre Peninsula and South West','South Australia - Outback','NT','Not yet populated',0,-22.391277,132.113680),(125,'Yulara','872','Eyre Peninsula and South West','South Australia - Outback','NT','Not yet populated',0,-25.242047,130.985560),(126,'Gove','880','East Arnhem','Northern Territory - Outback','NT','Not yet populated',0,-12.378064,130.871791),(127,'Nhulunbuy','880','East Arnhem','Northern Territory - Outback','NT','The town of Nhulunbuy was then established, housing the workers and their families, who were employed by the Swiss Aluminium company.

At one stage there were over 100 different nationalities present.[citation needed] During the 1970s the population rose to approximately 3,500 with 1,000 students at the combined primary and high school. A new high school was opened in 1981.\r\nNhulunbuy\'s population had already dropped by mid 2014, with some of the workforce retained to monitor the shutdown and survey holding ponds full of toxic compounds, but most will be gone by January 2015.[2][2] A range of measures were announced to support the town and its former workers through the closure and the following three years, but locals anticipate further cuts to services since the school, hospital, power plant and flights were backed by Rio Tinto.[7] The closure of the refinery also left flights on the Darwin-Nhulunbuy route to fall to around 50 to 60 per cent full, causing QantasLink to suspend flights on the route from 17 August 2014.[8]\r\nPermits are required to drive to Nhulunbuy — over 700 km of unsealed roads — so most supplies and visitors are brought by air to Gove Airport or by sea.\r\nMatthew Flinders, in his circumnavigation of Australia in 1803, met the Macassan trading fleet near present-day Nhulunbuy, an encounter that led to the establishment of settlements on Melville Island and the Coburg Peninsula. A beach close to the township is named Macassan Beach in honour of this encounter.\r\nThis area in Northeast Arnhem Land has been home to the Yolngu Aboriginal people for at least 40,000 years.\r\nNhulunbuy is only 20 km from the Indigenous community of Yirrkala, famous for its Aboriginal art.\r\nNhulunbuy is a township that was created on the Gove Peninsula in the Northern Territory of Australia when a bauxite mine and deep water port were established nearby in the late 1960s, followed by an alumina refinery.[2] At the 2011 census, Nhulunbuy had a population of 3,933 with a median age of 32.[1] The closure of the alumina refinery in May 2014 resulted in 1,100 workers being redeployed or made redundant, substantially reducing this population.[3]\r\nIn 1963, a Federal government decision excised part of the land for a bauxite mine to be operated by the North Australian Bauxite and Alumina Company (Nabalco).[citation needed] The Yolngu aborigines at Yirrkala were strongly opposed, and forwarded a bark petition to the Australian House of Representatives, which attracted national and international attention and which now hangs in Parliament House, Canberra.[citation needed]\r\nFor the purposes of granting tax rebates to residents of isolated areas as per Section 79A(3F) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, the census population of Nhulunbuy is taken to be less than 2,500).[4]\r\nIn 1999, the first classes of the Nhulunbuy Christian College (formerly known as Nhulunbuy Christian School) were held at the local TAFE centre, and in 2001 the first building of the new school was completed. In 2007 the NCC Middle School was opened and in 2008 the combined year 8/9 Class was first established.\r\nOn 29 November 2013 Rio Tinto announced the closure of the alumina refinery (but not the bauxite mine) by July 2014 with the loss of 1,100 jobs, or almost 25% of the town\'s population.[3][5] The refinery ceased production in May 2014.[6]\r\n',0,-12.184210,136.783889),(128,'Jabiru','886','Daly -

The cause of G7\'s crash was determined to be the heart attack of the driver and a failure of the safety equipment and the guard to stop the train. [4]\r\nWaterfall is the last suburb heading south on the Princes Highway before it leads into the Princes Motorway (formerly known as the F6 freeway) to the city of Wollongong.\r\nWaterfall is a small suburb in southern Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. It is 38 kilometres south of the Sydney central business district in the Sutherland Shire.\r\nWaterfall was a town created by rail workers, who built the line from Sydney to Wollongong in the late 19th century. It is the highest point on the line, with a steep rising gradient at one end, and a falling gradient at the other end, and sidings were provided in both directions to allow freight wagons to be stowed and shunted. Waterfall derived its name from the waterfalls close to the railway station. McKell Avenue, the southern border of the Royal National Park, was originally called Waterfall Road.[2]\r\nThe Waterfall train collision on 20 December 1994 involved two S-set electric trains which collided in the early hours of the morning during a shunting procedure at Waterfall station in the south of Sydney. Both trains were empty of passengers. Carriages jack-knifed in spectacular fashion onto the platform, causing demolition of a concrete ramp and part of the station canopy.\r\nWaterfall railway station is the terminus for the Sydney Trains suburban Eastern Suburbs & Illawarra Line. However, some trains do terminate one stop further on at Helensburgh. Waterfall is also a stop on the NSW TrainLink South Coast Line, with platform 1 to Sydney terminal, platform 2 to Port Kembla, Dapto and Kiama.\r\nWaterfall has only six streets. Its local school has only two rooms which have kindergarten to 2nd class in one room, and 3rd class to 6th class in another. The bushland gives the small suburb a natural surrounding and walking tracks lead from it into the neighbouring national parks. To the west is a dammed lake and behind it is Mount Westmacott.\r\nThe Waterfall State Sanitorium was established in 1909 for the treatment of tuberculosis patients. In 1973 Australia\'s first Community Advanced Driver Training Centre was opened in Waterfall but closed a few years later.

Helensburgh is the next town, travelling south. Waterfall marks the southern border of the Sutherland Shire.

It is near the Sydney-Newcastle Freeway and the western suburbs of Newcastle.\r\nA passenger service also once operated between Cockle Creek and West Wallsend, the latter having a fully manned station where tickets could be purchased to anywhere in the State which had a railway connection. The last passenger service to West Wallsend ran on 13 January 1930, and the line between Seahampton, West Wallsend, and the Fairley (Seaham No.2 Colliery) Junction closed on 26 November 1938. When Seaham No.2 closed in 1945 the only portion of the railway which continued in use, until 1962, was to Killingworth.\r\nAt the time of the opening, on 3 July 1888, it was estimated West Wallsend Colliery would produce up to 200,000 tons of coal a year. In 1895 Caledonian Collieries Limited purchased the company, its collieries, and the railway.\r\nOne mine still operates in the district[4] but its coal is shipped by road. The mine\'s owners have announced that it will be closed in 2016 for economic reasons.[5]\r\nThe booth at West Wallsend is considered very safe for the Labor Party.\r\nWest Wallsend is located in the federal Division of Charlton, which elects one member to the Australian House of Representatives. The current member, 2013 Federal Election, is Australian Labor Party member Pat Conroy. At state level, after a redistribution in 2006, West Wallsend moved from the Lake Macquarie electorate to the Cessnock electorate. The current State Member is Australian Labor Party member Clayton Barr.\r\nWest Wallsend\'s origins are in coal mining, the main concern being West Wallsend Colliery, from whose boundaries the old town grew. The West Wallsend Coal Company was formed in 1885 with a capital of £90,000 sterling. It secured 2,972 acres (12.03 km2) of freehold land at and around where the township now stands. A shaft of 492 feet (150.0 m) in depth serviced the Borehole seam of almost 5 feet (1.5 m) in thickness.\r\nDuring the industry slump in 1923 it was announced that West Wallsend Colliery would close, raising questions in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly. Regardless of massive reserves, the mine closed on 14 September 1923, 5,376,410 tons of coal having been extracted in its relatively short period of operations – 35 years.\r\nThe coal was shipped by the West Wallsend Coal Company\'s private railway[2] (which later had several branch line extensions to Seahampton, Fairley, and Killingworth) via Cockle Creek junction onto the government\'s main north-south line. An Act of Parliament was passed on 27 August 1886, for the construction of the line and an Amendment passed on 13 July 1887 permitted its connection to the government system. The original line had cost over £16,000 pounds sterling, and at Cockle Creek there were seven sets of sidings to handle the output of the collieries which used the line.[3]\r\nA primary school was opened in November 1889.[6] West Wallsend High School opened in 1964.[7]\r\nIn the early years of the 20th century, a steam tram service operated from West Wallsend via Young Wallsend to Wallsend where there was a large shopping district and where it also connected with the electric trams which ran into Newcastle.',0,-32.902476,151.582846),(934,'Birmingham Gardens','2287','Lake Macquarie -

He travelled to school in Nabiac for his primary and early high school education.\r\nNabiac is the central town of the Wallamba Valley. As is typical of small North Coast towns, it developed in the second half of the 19th century as a small river port (later called Bullocks Wharf on the eastern edge of the town) for the hardwood-cutting (mainly Australian red cedar) trade. Later as the valley was cleared, small-scale dairying and corn-growing became dominant. At first milk was mainly bought by the dairy at Dyers Crossing (about 6 km west of Nabiac). Later fresh milk was also supplied to the Sydney market via the Sydney Milk Board. Prior to the mid-1950s, Nabiac was relatively isolated, but the relocation of the Pacific Highway at that time changed its nature, and it has steadily become more of a highway service town and tourist stopping point.',0,-32.098694,152.377769),(1014,'Williamtown Raaf','2314','Port Stephens','Hunter Valley exc Newcastle','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-32.797365,151.836990),(1015,'Corlette','2315','Port Stephens','Hunter Valley exc Newcastle','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-32.721158,152.106782),(1016,'Fingal Bay','2315','Port Stephens','Hunter Valley exc Newcastle','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-32.748113,152.170141),(1018,'Shoal Bay','2315','Port Stephens','Hunter Valley exc Newcastle','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-32.724136,152.174979),(1019,'Anna Bay','2316','Port Stephens','Hunter Valley exc Newcastle','NSW','\r\nDuring World War II Stockton Beach was heavily fortified against a possible amphibious assault by Imperial Japanese forces and a line of tank traps was installed to prevent entry to the local area through the town.

There are also several picnic spots and old houses and buildings to see.\r\nIn the 2006 census the locality had a population of approximately 2,100 while the township, which is the largest population centre in the area, had a population of 794.[1][2]\r\nIn 2007 devastating floodwaters caused havoc in the Hunter Valley and claimed the lives of two people on a bridge into Clarence Town from Seaham, New South Wales.[6]\r\nJust out of town a little way is the Good Samaritan Donkey Sanctuary, which cares for mistreated donkeys. Visitors are welcomed; however appointments are required, except on advertised open days.[5]\r\nThe area was originally inhabited by the Wanaruah Aboriginal people who called it Erringhi.[3] There is a hotel in the main street of Clarence Town built in 1913 called The Erringhi Hotel.\r\nClarence Town is both a primarily rural locality and a township in the Dungog Shire local government area in the Hunter Region of New South Wales, Australia. It is 193 kilometres (120 mi) north of Sydney, 54 km (34 mi) north-north-west of Newcastle, and 28 km (17 mi) from the Pacific Highway at Raymond Terrace. The locality is bisected by the Williams River. The township sits just to the west of the river about 32 km (20 mi) upstream from where it flows into the Hunter River at Raymond Terrace.\r\nThe township is most famous for building and launching the William IV paddle steamer in 1831, although the town was still called Erringhi at this time. It was later renamed in 1832 after the Duke of Clarence, who became King William IV in 1830.[3][4]',0,-32.583661,151.779596),(1070,'Cliftleigh','2321','Lower Hunter','Hunter Valley exc Newcastle','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-32.784916,151.523259),(1071,'Duckenfield','2321','Lower Hunter','Hunter Valley exc Newcastle','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-32.740212,151.684977),(1072,'Duns Creek','2321','Lower Hunter','Hunter Valley exc Newcastle','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-32.580313,151.782750),(1073,'Gillieston Heights','2321','Lower Hunter','Hunter Valley exc Newcastle','NSW','As the coal mining activities in the area were expanded, the railway line from Maitland was extended further to the south, and a station platform was opened at East Greta in 1902, with passenger services to Stanford Merthyr near the town of Kurri Kurri. Initially, passengers had to walk to Maitland railway station to connect with trains operated by New South Wales Government Railways, but in 1903 this service was extended to Maitland, and a year later to Cessnock on the newly extended South Maitland Railway. Mining operations at the East Greta colliery ceased following a miners strike in 1929 and subsidence caused by floods in 1930s damaged the workings.[11] With the closure of the mine, rail services also ceased, while the village consisting of permanent dwellings which had been erected to house miners remained.\r\nGillieston Heights is served by Rover Coaches route 164 to Cessnock and Maitland. The rapid population growth in the suburb and other former mining villages in the area has led to calls by Maitland and Cessnock councils to reinstate passenger services on the South Maitland Railway, connecting to Newcastle to ease congestion on regional roads. A new station at Gillieston Heights has been identified as a priority.[13]\r\nSince 2005, Gillieston Heights has experienced rapid population growth, with large residential developments approved as part of the Maitland City Council\'s urban settlement strategy. The population doubled between 2005 and 2011, with the rapid growth placing pressure on Gillieston Public School, leading to the acquisition of more land for future expansion.[12]\r\nGillieston Heights is a suburb of the City of Maitland local government area in the Hunter Region of New South Wales, Australia, approximately 5.1 km (3.2 mi) from the Maitland CBD.[3][4][8] Prior to 1967, the village was named East Greta however this was changed to honour former Maitland mayor and member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly John Gillies following a poll of residents.[4][9] At the 2011 census, Gillieston Heights had a population of 1,372.[1]\r\nFollowing the discovery of high quality coal by prospector T.W. Edgeworth David in 1888, a group of local businessmen purchased 245 acres (99 ha) of land surrounding present-day Gillieston Heights and were within weeks able to produce coal which was transported by dray to Maitland for sale. To capitalise on this success, the East Greta Coal Mining Company was established in 1891. The company constructed a railway line from West Maitland to the East Greta colliery, completed in 1893. Orders to supply coal for power companies in Sydney, Melbourne and Bundaberg saw the company declare a dividend in 1896 and expand its operations, sinking a second mine shaft the same year.[10]',0,-32.766353,151.527365),(1074,'Glen Martin','2321','Lower Hunter','Hunter Valley exc Newcastle','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-32.538780,151.825623),(1075,'Glen William','2321','Lower Hunter','Hunter Valley exc Newcastle','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-32.521508,151.797570),(1076,'Harpers Hill','2321','Lower Hunter','Hunter Valley exc Newcastle','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-32.700507,151.412711),(1077,'Heddon Greta','2321','Lower Hunter','Hunter Valley exc Newcastle','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-32.804507,151.509565),(1078,'Hinton','2321','Lower Hunter','Hunter Valley exc Newcastle','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-32.716588,151.651388),(1079,'Lochinvar','2321','Lower Hunter','Hunter Valley exc Newcastle','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-32.699039,151.454790),(1080,'Luskintyre','2321','Lower Hunter','Hunter Valley exc Newcastle','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-32.649390,151.431085),(1081,'Morpeth','2321','Lower Hunter','Hunter Valley exc Newcastle','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-32.724882,151.626663),(1082,'Oswald','2321','Lower Hunter','Hunter Valley exc Newcastle','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-32.702548,151.421295),(1083,'Phoenix Park','2321','Lower Hunter','Hunter Valley exc Newcastle','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-32.709593,151.629529),(1084,'Raworth','2321','Lower Hunter','Hunter Valley exc Newcastle','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-32.735981,151.607064),(1085,'Woodville','2321','Lower Hunter','Hunter Valley exc Newcastle','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-32.676183,151.609950),(1086,'Beresfield','2322','Lower Hunter','Hunter Valley exc Newcastle','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-32.801094,151.657881),(1087,'Black Hill','2322','Lower Hunter','Hunter Valley exc Newcastle','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-32.823598,151.583655),(1089,'Lenaghan','2322','Lower Hunter','Hunter Valley exc Newcastle','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-32.849201,151.627282),(1090,'Stockrington','2322','Lower Hunter','Hunter Valley exc Newcastle','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-32.861825,151.606080),(1091,'Tarro','2322','Lower Hunter','Hunter Valley exc Newcastle','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-32.808847,151.668182),(1092,'Thornton','2322','Lower Hunter','Hunter Valley exc Newcastle','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-32.776905,151.638803),(1093,'Tomago','2322','Lower Hunter','Hunter Valley exc Newcastle','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-32.818383,151.757485),(1094,'Woodberry','2322','Lower Hunter','Hunter Valley exc Newcastle','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-32.793692,151.665395),(1095,'Ashtonfield','2323','Lower Hunter','Hunter Valley exc Newcastle','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-32.773820,151.601000),(1096,'Brunkerville','2323','Lower Hunter','Hunter Valley exc Newcastle','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-32.948838,151.478758),(1097,'Buchanan','2323','Lower Hunter','Hunter Valley exc Newcastle','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-32.825353,151.529302),(1098,'Buttai','2323','Lower Hunter','Hunter Valley exc Newcastle','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-32.819352,151.560660),(1099,'East Maitland','2323','Lower Hunter','Hunter Valley exc Newcastle','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-32.751120,151.589963),(1100,'Freemans Waterhole','2323','Lower Hunter','Hunter Valley exc Newcastle','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-32.981679,151.483971),(1101,'Metford','2323','Lower Hunter','Hunter Valley exc Newcastle','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-32.765913,151.609200),(1102,'Mount Vincent','2323','Lower Hunter','Hunter Valley exc Newcastle','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-32.917382,151.477444),(1103,'Mulbring','2323','Lower Hunter','Hunter Valley exc Newcastle','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-32.900377,151.483000),(1104,'Pitnacree','2323','Lower Hunter','Hunter Valley exc Newcastle','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-32.730455,151.593483),(1105,'Richmond Vale','2323','Lower Hunter','Hunter Valley exc Newcastle','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-32.871313,151.478622),(1106,'Tenambit','2323','Lower Hunter','Hunter Valley exc Newcastle','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-32.743257,151.604325),(1107,'Balickera','2324','Maitland','Hunter Valley exc Newcastle','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-32.673022,151.805367),(1108,'Brandy Hill','2324','Maitland','Hunter Valley exc Newcastle','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-32.693797,151.694171),(1109,'Bundabah','2324','Maitland','Hunter Valley exc Newcastle','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-32.662213,152.074063),(1110,'Carrington','2324','Maitland','Hunter Valley exc Newcastle','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-32.664342,152.018722),(1111,'Springvale','3171','Dandenong','Melbourne -

The suburb is about 220 km (137 mi) north of Sydney, 12 km (7.5 mi)) from the Pacific Highway. It is bordered by the Tasman Sea to the east, the Myall River to the west and Port Stephens to the south. It includes Yacaaba, the northern headland of Port Stephens, which rises to 210 metres (690 ft) above mean sea level. However, the rest of the suburb is generally low, flat, sandy and covered in coastal scrubland, with some bushland, resulting in the northern part of the suburb being accessible only by four-wheel drive vehicles until the 1980s.[6][7]\r\nThe local golf course was designed by Matt Lauder, a professional golfer and nephew of Scottish comedian, Sir Harry Lauder.[9]\r\nAnimals such as koalas, dingoes and dolphins can be observed in the area.\r\nAt the 2006 census, Hawks Nest had a population of 1,027 living in the southern part of the suburb.[1] While nearby Tea Gardens is primarily a residential and commercial area, Hawks Nest tends to be dominated by holiday rentals and caravan parks which causes the population to vary considerably with the influx of tourists.\r\nJimmys Beach and the Tasman Sea on the east (Bennetts Beach or The Main Beach, as it is commonly referred to) are popular resorts. The Myall Lakes are a short drive north. Hawks Nest has many shops and cafes catering to the tourist trade and, with its sandy beaches and bush walks, proximity to Sydney, and much greater seclusion than suburbs on the southern shores of Port Stephens, it is a popular weekend getaway for Sydneysiders. Hawks Nest was well known as the location of holiday retreats belonging to then Prime Minister John Howard until, in 1998, he decided to abandon his family\'s regular holiday spot of twenty years due to alleged media harassment.[8] John Howard has returned to Hawks Nest after leaving politics.[citation needed]\r\nHoliday activities in the area include swimming, snorkeling and diving, golfing, bush walking, dolphin and whale spotting, four-wheel driving, caravanning and fishing.\r\nHawks Nest is located directly across the river from Tea Gardens and was connected by the Singing Bridge in 1974. Before this the river crossing was made by a small car ferry. Most (approximately 95%) of the suburb is still uninhabited with the population concentrated around the Hawks Nest township, on the Myall River and Winda Woppa on Port Stephens.[6]\r\nHawks Nest is a suburb of the Mid-Coast Council local government area in the Hunter and Mid North Coast regions of New South Wales, Australia, located north of Port Stephens between the Tasman Sea and the Myall River.[2][3][6] It was named after a large hawk\'s nest in a tree on the Myall River that was used as a navigational aid.[3]',0,-32.671611,152.177506),(1115,'Heatherbrae','2324','Maitland','Hunter Valley exc Newcastle','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-32.787426,151.732386),(1116,'Karuah','2324','Maitland','Hunter Valley exc Newcastle','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-32.654064,151.961443),(1117,'Limeburners Creek','2324','Maitland','Hunter Valley exc Newcastle','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-32.589168,151.907551),(1118,'Millers Forest','2324','Maitland','Hunter Valley exc Newcastle','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-32.763539,151.702595),(1119,'Nelsons Plains','2324','Maitland','Hunter Valley exc Newcastle','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-32.702329,151.710584),(1120,'North Arm Cove','2324','Maitland','Hunter Valley exc Newcastle','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-32.659120,152.037583),(1121,'Osterley','2324','Maitland','Hunter Valley exc Newcastle','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-32.724756,151.700846),(1122,'Pindimar','2324','Maitland','Hunter Valley exc Newcastle','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-32.684153,152.098138),(1124,'Raymond Terrace East','2324','Maitland','Hunter Valley exc Newcastle','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-32.760671,151.776788),(1125,'Seaham','2324','Maitland','Hunter Valley exc Newcastle','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-32.657672,151.721912),(1126,'Swan Bay','2324','Maitland','Hunter Valley exc Newcastle','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-32.702421,151.965498),(1127,'Tahlee','2324','Maitland','Hunter Valley exc Newcastle','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-32.667511,152.004792),(1128,'Tea Gardens','2324','Maitland','Hunter Valley exc Newcastle','NSW','Tea Gardens extends along the west bank of the Myall River from Port Stephens about 14 kilometres (8.7 mi) in a north-north-easterly direction.

At one time there were several sidings near the station with grain silos, stock yards, loading bank, goods shed, hay stage, and loco platform. In the 1980s services were suspended between Cowra and Blayney. The section was re-opened by the Lachlan Valley Railway which runs heritage trains from Cowra to Blayney. The railway station is now an art gallery and private residence.\r\nGold was discovered in 1868 at Woods Flat, a few kilometres south of Woodstock. A rush of 500 diggers took up the ground there, but after a short period only a few were left as surface gold was minimal and water supplies lacking. The goldfield had a long history but today almost nothing remains of the buildings at Woods Flat. The village of Woodstock was established in response to the building of the railway line north of Woods Flat, from Blayney to Cowra in 1880s. Initially known also as Woods Flat, the name of the village was changed to Woodstock in 1886.[3]\r\nBy 1900 there were many commercial businesses in the villages including butchers, bakers, hotels, saddleries, smithies, bootmakers, mercers, tailors, motor vehicle garages and billiard rooms. A post office was operating by 1897. The current Royal Hotel was rebuilt in 1911, an earlier timber building having been destroyed by fire. The Commercial Banking Company of Sydney opened a branch at Woodstock in 1907, followed by the Commonwealth Savings Bank in 1913 and the Bank of New South Wales in 1929. The Soldiers Memorial Hall was opened in 1925 by Sir Neville Reginald Howse, who was at that time the Member for Calare.[4]\r\nCountry markets are held at Woodstock Soldiers Memorial Hall on the second Sunday of each month except January. The Memorial Hall hosts a touring opera company, OperaWorks, each year. Other events at Woodstock include a long track motorbike championships and the annual show.\r\nThe bushranger John Vane, a member of Ben Hall\'s gang, who died in 1906 was buried in an unmarked grave at Woodstock cemetery. A headstone was erected by local historians in 1989.\r\nMedia related to Woodstock, New South Wales at Wikimedia Commons\r\nWoodstock is a village in the central west of New South Wales, Australia, 21 kilometres (13 mi) east of Cowra. It contains remains of a brief goldrush during the late 19th century which left behind a number of substantial buildings before the village relapsed into relative isolation. It includes a restored railway station, hotel and a memorial hall. At the 2011 census, Woodstock had a population of 812.[1]',0,-29.732366,151.364377),(1500,'Atholwood','2361','Inverell - Tenterfield','New England and North West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-28.999641,151.058013),(1501,'Limestone','2361','Inverell -

Tenterfield','New England and North West','NSW','The Jennings Public School, still in operation and sited virtually opposite the Wallangarra School in Queensland, was established in 1889 following representations from the Officer in Charge of Customs for New South Wales at Wallangarra.[7] During World War II, an ammunition dump was established at Jennings due to the break-of-gauge at Wallangarra railway station.[8] The dump along with a general army store in Wallangarra still exist today.[9][10]\r\nA modern survey of the Queensland/New South Wales border, conducted as a Centenary of Federation project in 2001, found an error of 200 metres (700 ft) in the original border survey, conducted between 1863–66, near Jennings. This indicates that if the border was placed where originally intended, Jennings would be located in Queensland rather than New South Wales.[11]\r\nThe rail line from Brisbane reached Wallangarra in 1887, a year before the Main North railway line reached Jennings from Sydney in 1888. A break-of-gauge station was established on the border with the north platform part of the Queensland rail network and the southern platform maintained by New South Wales.[3] After several changes of name between the two towns, in 1904, the name of the station was confirmed as Wallangarra.[4] A Jennings Railway Station Telegraph Office opened on 16 January 1888. In 1904 it was renamed by a Wallangarra Receiving Office.[5] The Wallangarra Post Office in Queensland was opened in 1885.[6] Passenger rail services to Brisbane ceased in 1972 and the New South Wales line was closed north of Tenterfield to rail traffic in 1989. The station, refurbished in 2001, is now listed on the Queensland Heritage Register.[3]\r\nJennings is a town on the Northern Tablelands region of New South Wales, Australia. The town is located in the Tenterfield Shire local government area, 718 kilometres (446 mi) from the state capital, Sydney and 256 kilometres (159 mi) from Brisbane. It is separated by the state border from its neighbouring town of Wallangarra in Queensland. At the 2011 census, Jennings had a population of 211.[1] The New England Highway and the Main North railway line cross the state border at Jennings. The town was named for Sir Patrick Jennings, the first Roman Catholic Premier of New South Wales.[2]',0,-28.927903,151.927109),(1576,'Leechs Gully','2372','Inverell - Tenterfield','New England and North West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-29.012297,152.032025),(1577,'Liston','2372','Inverell - Tenterfield','New England and North West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-28.647747,152.086292),(1578,'Mingoola','2372','Inverell - Tenterfield','New England and North West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-28.990857,151.527234),(1579,'Mole River','2372','Inverell - Tenterfield','New England and North West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-29.006939,151.564636),(1580,'Mount Mackenzie','2372','Inverell - Tenterfield','New England and North West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-29.083289,151.950141),(1581,'Pyes Creek','2372','Inverell - Tenterfield','New England and North West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-29.230075,151.839078),(1582,'Rivertree','2372','Inverell - Tenterfield','New England and North West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-28.627663,152.294309),(1583,'Rocky River','2372','Inverell - Tenterfield','New England and North West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-29.111355,152.354169),(1584,'Sandy Flat','2372','Inverell - Tenterfield','New England and North West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-29.233738,152.005604),(1585,'Sandy Hill','2372','Inverell - Tenterfield','New England and North West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-28.922170,152.244322),(1586,'Silent Grove','2372','Inverell - Tenterfield','New England and North West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-29.147162,151.666126),(1587,'Steinbrook','2372','Inverell - Tenterfield','New England and North West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-29.090908,152.093607),(1588,'Sunnyside','2372','Inverell - Tenterfield','New England and North West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-29.002863,151.940619),(1589,'Tarban','2372','Inverell - Tenterfield','New England and North West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-28.974138,151.912927),(1590,'Tenterfield','2372','Inverell - Tenterfield','New England and North West','NSW','In 1841, Sir Stuart Donaldson was running 18,000 sheep on a property that he named Tenterfield Station, after a family home in Scotland. Donaldson was the first premier of NSW and made biannual trips to Tenterfield to inspect his holdings there, which covered 100,000 acres (400 km2) of unfenced land. Tenterfield Post Office opened on 1 January 1849[2] and the township was gazetted in 1851 with allotments being sold in 1854. In 1858 gold was discovered at Drake (Fairfield) and shortly afterwards at Timbarra and Boonoo Boonoo.[3] During 1859 an AJS Bank opened and an Anglican church was built the following year. In the 1860s the Tenterfield Chronicle was published, the district court was established; the building of a hospital commenced and a public school was opened. In 1870 the population was less than 900, but the town had five hotels, a school of arts and three churches. The existing Tenterfield Post Office was constructed in 1881.\r\nABC New England North West and ABC Radio National broadcast to Tenterfield on local FM repeaters.\r\nThe main industries in the Tenterfield district are beef cattle breeding and superfine wool production through the breeding of Merino sheep. There are ten State Forests in the Tenterfield district covering 7540ha.[11]\r\nTenterfield\'s local newspaper is The Tenterfield Star, which is a weekly newspaper issued each Wednesday. The newspaper has been published for more than 170 years and was once owned by J. F. Thomas, the solicitor who defended Breaker Morant.\r\nTenterfield has a subtropical highland climate, with cold, frosty winters and warm, wet summers. It sits at an altitude of 850 metres (2,790 ft) above sea level, meaning temperatures below freezing in winter are common, and Tenterfield averages 47 days where the minimum temperature drops below 0 °C each year.[12] Summers are warm, but rarely hot and most of the rain falls as thunderstorms, which can be severe. Tenterfield\'s highest recorded temperature was 49.5 °C in February 2002. Its coldest recorded temperature was -18 °C, which has been reached numerous times over the years.\r\n100.9 Triple Z FM, based in Goonellabah NSW runs radio advertisements for services that run from the coast to as far inland as Tenterfield and Glen Innes, and can be tuned into from higher elevations in Tenterfield when windy and anywhere in town on windless days.\r\nTenterfield-based community radio station Ten FM provides a more local focus, derived in part from the stringent rules controlling community radio stations. The station also broadcasts to Stanthorpe north of the border, on a separate frequency.\r\nThe following buildings and sites are listed on the Register of the National Estate.[7]\r\nThe only commercial radio stations serving Tenterfield are Rebel Media stations, Rebel FM and The Breeze which broadcast into the area from Queensland on local FM transmitters.\r\nSir Henry Parkes delivered his Federation Speech in the Tenterfield School of Arts on 24 October 1889.[5] He was travelling from Brisbane to Sydney, via the new Main North railway. The speech is credited with re-igniting the debate that ultimately led to Federation on 1 January 1901.\r\nThere was considerable debate about whether the break of gauge should take place at the existing town of Tenterfield, or at a whole new town at the border at Wallangarra.[6]\r\nDuring World War II, Tenterfield was earmarked as a key battleground if the Japanese should invade Australia. During 1942 thousands of soldiers were set up in emergency camps, unbeknown to the locals, to cope with such an event. Overgrown tank traps and gun emplacements can still be seen on the Travelling Stock Route near the New England Highway.[4] The highway was until the early 1950s the only all-weather road from Sydney to Brisbane.\r\nThe railway opened to Tenterfield on 28 October 1884[5] and in 1886 to nearby Wallangarra on the Queensland border, connecting Sydney and Brisbane, with a break-of-gauge at Wallangarra. When the rail link to the Queensland border was completed, Sydney and Brisbane were linked by rail for the first time. The railway was subsequently bypassed by the fully standard gauge North Coast line between Sydney and Brisbane, completed in 1932. The Main North line is now closed north of Armidale and the Tenterfield railway station is now a museum.\r\nTenterfield is incorporated into the Lismore television licence area and as such receives regional news bulletins on Prime7 and NBN Television along with brief local news updates on Southern Cross Ten.\r\nThe local geography is dominated by prominent granite inselbergs and mountains, the most famous being that of Bald Rock, which sits within the Bald Rock National Park, and Bluff Rock which is located 12 minutes drive south of Tenterfield on the New England Highway.\r\nTenterfield is a town in New South Wales, Australia.

In 2006, the town had a population of 495 people.[1] The road linking these two towns closely follows the meandering Castlereagh River. There are many pleasant areas to stop beside the road and on the river banks to have a picnic. Binnaway is also located near the similarly sized small town of Mendooran. Following local government amalgamation, the town is now located in the Warrumbungle Shire Council area which is headquartered at Coonabarabran.\r\nThere are also a number of popular 4x4 and motor cross tracks to explore.\r\nThe name Binnaway may derive from an Aboriginal term which means peppermint tree. The first landholder in the areas was Charles Naseby who claimed 50 acres (200,000 m²) in 1869. The village of Binnaway was initially set up on his land with a plan for the town being laid out in 1876. A street in the town is named Renshaw Street after the former Premier of New South Wales Jack Renshaw who grew up and went to school in the area.\r\nA film called The Shiralee which starred Peter Finch was filmed around Binnaway in the 1950s.\r\nBinnaway was also home to Frank Bourke\'s famous White Rose Orchestra and the big Piano It was a major railway town and a large wheat receival area. The railway still runs from Dubbo to Werris Creek in the North.\r\nThe town hosts the Binnaway Bowling club located at the southern end of the town.

Four hundred people were evacuated and the township was isolated for two weeks.[11]\r\nIn 1851 James and Mary Brand arrived and built a general store on the banks of the river in 1852. A post office was added the following year. The family sold up and moved to the Hunter Region in 1857 but James died in 1858 leaving Mary with six children so she returned opened another business and in 1861 she opened the town\'s first inn.[4]\r\nAs closer settlement proceeded agriculture emerged as a thriving industry on the fertile flood plains. Banking began in 1876 and the first local newspaper was set up in 1881, at which time the population was 295.[citation needed]\r\nMary Brand (1827–1900) was the first female shopkeeper and first hotelier in Moree.[34] She is commemorated by the town\'s Mary Brand Park, where a replica of her shop and house were situated until they burnt down in 2012.[35] She is also buried in the Moree Cemetery.[5]\r\nMoree was one of the destinations of the famous 1965 Freedom Bus ride, an historic trip through northern NSW led by Charles Perkins to bring media attention to discrimination against indigenous Australians. It brought racial segregation in rural Australia to the attention of urban Australians, in particular at the Moree public swimming pool as well as pubs and theatres, where Aborigines were refused entry. At the Moree swimming pool, after a confrontation with the council and pool management, it was agreed that indigenous children could swim in the pool outside school hours.[7][8][9][10]\r\nRadio stations 2VM and 98.3 NOW FM also broadcast from Moree. The NOW FM transmitter site is located on Mt Dowe, whilst the 2VM transmitter is located 5 kilometres east of Moree on the Gwydir Highway. Both stations are owned by the Broadcast Operations Group and broadcasts week day breakfast and afternoon programs.\r\nMoree was gazetted as a town in 1862 with land sales proceeding that year. A court of petty sessions was established in 1863 and there was a severe flood in 1864. The first constable arrived and a police station was set up in 1865. The first church (Wesleyan) was built in 1867 when the town had a population of 43.[4]\r\nIn January 1946 a flood cut the township in two, and several hundred homes were flooded.[16] The flood waters affected the local power station which caused a blackout. The floods also damaged roads and railway lines in the region.[16] The Gwydir River bridge at Moree was also damaged.[17]\r\nAustralian rugby union player Van Humphries grew up in Moree.\r\nMoree is served by the Moree Champion newspaper owned by Rural Press which is published on Tuesdays and Thursdays.\r\nMoree Courthouse in Frome Street\r\nIn January 1910 floods in the Moree district caused numerous washouts of the railway to Moree. An unknown number of livestock were drowned, and at least 4 people drowned in the Moree area.[14][15]\r\nMary Gaudron was the first female Justice of the High Court of Australia.\r\nOther significant floods have occurred in 1864,1890, 1921, 1949, 1950, 1956, 1974, 1984, 1998 and 2004.[11][25]\r\nWheat cultivation increased after World War II with a flour mill built at Moree in 1951 and the first commercial pecan nut farm was established on the Gwydir Highway east of Moree in 1966. The Trawalla Pecan Nut Farm is the largest pecan nut farm in the southern hemisphere, growing about 75,000 trees. In 1994 the Gwydir Olive Grove Company was established when two Moree families started producing olive oil from olives grown in the area.[6]\r\nMoree Memorial Hall\r\nThe Kamilaroi people, whose descendants are still in the town, were the early inhabitants of the area.[5] Major Sir Thomas Mitchell went to the district at the request of the acting governor after the recapture of escaped convict George Clarke who told of a great river called the Kindur in 1832. Clarke had been living in the area to the south with the Kamilaroi from 1826-1831. Squatters soon followed in Mitchell\'s wake establishing pastoral runs, among which was \'Moree\' (1844), from a Kamilaroi term believed to mean either \'long waterhole\' or \'rising sun\'.\r\nIn February 2001,another major flood peak was recorded in Moree. There were a few houses with over floor flooding.

In 2011, Bingara had a population of 1,093 people.[1] and is currently the administrative centre for the Gwydir Shire that was created in 2003. It has a culturally homogeneous population as residents are mostly of Anglo-Celtic background. Only 9.4% of the population is born overseas and 3.3% is of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander background.[1] It is a popular site for retirement and hence has an old population, with 53.8% aged 55 years and over, compared to the national average of 26.4%.[1] Bingara\'s socioeconomic status is comparatively lower than that of Australia. Bingara is one of the few places in Australia where diamonds have been found. The Gwydir River being a main highlight of the town is a main catchment of the Murray-Darling System.\r\nIn 1827 Allan Cunningham crossed the Gwydir River near Bingara. At the time he mistook the river to be the Peel River, but realised his mistake on his return journey. The discovery of gold in 1852 brought prospectors to the area. In the 1880s, copper and diamonds were discovered also, causing a rapid development of the town. Bingara is one of the few places in Australia where diamonds have been found. In fact, Bingara was the largest producer of diamonds in Australia at that time. Bingara changed the spelling of its name from Bingera to Bingara in 1890.[7] The first Bingera Post Office opened on 1 January 1853 and was renamed Upper Bingera in 1862 and closed in 1868. The second Bingera office opened in 1862 and was renamed Bingara in 1890.[8]',0,-29.868713,150.571783),(1677,'Dinoga','2404','Inverell - Tenterfield','New England and North West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-29.913543,150.639454),(1678,'Elcombe','2404','Inverell - Tenterfield','New England and North West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-29.853824,150.514282),(1679,'Gineroi','2404','Inverell - Tenterfield','New England and North West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-29.680079,150.451120),(1680,'Keera','2404','Inverell - Tenterfield','New England and North West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-29.989848,150.872190),(1681,'Pallal','2404','Inverell - Tenterfield','New England and North West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-29.970240,150.428611),(1682,'Riverview','2404','Inverell - Tenterfield','New England and North West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-29.904643,150.687307),(1683,'Upper Bingara','2404','Inverell - Tenterfield','New England and North West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-30.058980,150.644229),(1684,'Boomi','2405','Moree - Narrabri','New England and North West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-28.725412,149.579150),(1685,'Garah','2405','Moree - Narrabri','New England and North West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-29.075482,149.636398),(1686,'Mungindi','2406','Moree - Narrabri','New England and North West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-28.999013,149.100731),(1687,'Weemelah','2406','Moree - Narrabri','New England and North West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-29.017622,149.253657),(1688,'North Star','2408','Moree - Narrabri','New England and North West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-28.932590,150.391368),(1690,'Boonal','2409','Inverell - Tenterfield','New England and North West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-28.785002,150.523603),(1691,'Blue Nobby','2410','Inverell - Tenterfield','New England and North West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-29.045063,150.644388),(1692,'Twin Rivers','2410','Inverell - Tenterfield','New England and North West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-28.651569,150.731604),(1693,'Yetman','2410','Inverell - Tenterfield','New England and North West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-28.902557,150.780675),(1694,'Croppa Creek','2411','Inverell - Tenterfield','New England and North West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-29.129441,150.381167),(1695,'Yallaroi','2411','Inverell - Tenterfield','New England and North West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-29.119429,150.480818),(1696,'Monkerai','2415','Lower Hunter','Hunter Valley exc Newcastle','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-32.292336,151.859784),(1697,'Nooroo','2415','Lower Hunter','Hunter Valley exc Newcastle','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-32.380500,151.887703),(1698,'Stroud Road','2415','Lower Hunter','Hunter Valley exc Newcastle','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-32.344759,151.929068),(1699,'Upper Karuah River','2415','Lower Hunter','Hunter Valley exc Newcastle','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-32.195999,151.792437),(1700,'Weismantels','2415','Lower Hunter','Hunter Valley exc Newcastle','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-32.258251,151.938370),(1701,'Alison','2420','Lower Hunter','Hunter Valley exc Newcastle','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-32.434801,151.771934),(1702,'Bandon Grove','2420','Lower Hunter','Hunter Valley exc Newcastle','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-32.299862,151.715890),(1703,'Bendolba','2420','Lower Hunter','Hunter Valley exc Newcastle','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-32.326976,151.725998),(1704,'Brookfield','2420','Lower Hunter','Hunter Valley exc Newcastle','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-32.505586,151.762128),(1705,'Cambra','2420','Lower Hunter','Hunter Valley exc Newcastle','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-32.455835,151.830460),(1706,'Chichester','2420','Lower Hunter','Hunter Valley exc Newcastle','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-32.195437,151.618784),(1707,'Dungog','2420','Lower Hunter','Hunter Valley exc Newcastle','NSW','Since the 1950s, few new public buildings and shops have been erected but homes have continued to be built in weatherboard, brick, fibro or concrete; following the fashions of the time. While dairying has declined, the beef industry has remained, and although most timber is now locked up in national parks, many visitors come these days to enjoy the area\'s natural beauty. This trend has also meant that numerous older homes have been saved from deterioration by ‘tree-changers’, who have increasingly bought and renovated older homes in Dungog and its surrounding countryside.[9]\r\nThe Dungog Film Festival, inaugurated on 31 May 2007, is a film festival which serves the dual purposes of encouraging the local tourism industry and showcasing Australian cinema. It takes place over four days and some of the proceeds go towards preserving the James Theatre.[11][12][13] It is held annually in May and is open to Australian filmmakers only.\r\nThe core of the display is Dungog: The Making of a Community, telling the story of Dungog via different themes. The colourful panels were produced with a grant from the NSW Ministry of the Arts. Temporary exhibitions are also held.\r\nIt retains the simplicity of a Picture Theatre built in a small country town during the Great Depression. The building is architecturally significant as one of only four Picture Theatres in the New South Wales with Spanish Mission Style facades.[citation needed] The James Theatre Dungog Community Centre has been owned by the Dungog Shire Council since 1979.[citation needed]\r\nFounded in 1963, Dungog Historical Society is located in the former School of Arts building which also houses the Dungog Museum. The wide collection showcases Dungog\'s history and heritage, including information and material about local aboriginals and family history.\r\nThe Second World War was just beginning when the Dungog Chronicle reported: Recent weeks have seen a progressive building campaign in Dungog. Apart from the palatial new building for the Royal Hotel erected and furnished at a cost of some ₤20,000, and remodelling of the Court House Hotel and Bank Hotel, nine new residences have been completed within the past month.\r\nBy 1825 Robert Dawson had named the Barrington area, while surveyor Thomas Florance named the Chichester River in 1827.[citation needed] Two years later George Boyle White explored the sources of the Allyn and Williams rivers. Grants along the Williams followed to men such as Duncan Mackay, John Verge, James Dowling (later a NSW Chief Justice) and others, who, with their assigned convicts, began clearing land and building houses around a district that was by the early 1830s centred on a small settlement first known as Upper William. With a Court of Petty Sessions in 1833 and gazetted in 1838 as the village of Dungog (a local Gringai word), it had a court house, lockup and an increasing number of inns, shops and houses.[citation needed]\r\nCricketer Doug Walters and geographer Reginald Golledge were born in Dungog. Dave Sands, one of Australia\'s well known boxers, was killed near Dungog in 1952 aged 26.\r\nPopular Dungog events are the Dungog Film Festival hosted at the James Theatre, the Dungog Agricultural Show, Pedalfest, the Dungog Rodeo, and the Thunderbolt Rally. Each of these events showcase local produce and talent and bring tourists to the region.\r\nDungog is the home of the James Theatre, the oldest fully enclosed purpose-built cinema still operating in Australia[citation needed], located at 6 Brown Street. It receives new movie releases soon after cinemas in more populated areas. The Dungog Film Society has been operating from the cinema since 1992 and screens fine films monthly to locals as well as bringing Flickerfest to Dungog and an AGOG weekend of foreign films in September. The theatre is the venue for the Dungog Film Festival, which is held annually.\r\nIn addition to these works, the Education Department is clearing and grading the playing grounds at the public school, and has erected an ornate brick fence along those grounds on the Dowling-street frontage, whilst the Municipal Council has had two chains of kerbing and guttering carried out in Mary-street. (Dungog Chronicle, 24 November 1939)\r\nThe traditional owners of the area now known as Dungog are the Gringai clan of the Wonnarua people, a group of indigenous people of Australia.[8]\r\nDungog also has a Rugby League club called the Dungog Warriors which has teams competing in junior and senior competitions. Additionally, Dungog has a Cricket Club and a Netball Association.\r\nLord St, as were Dowling, Mackay, Chapman, Hooke, Brown and Myles, were all named after landowners at the time surveyor Francis Rusden drew up his generous 1838 grid plan of Dungog\'s streets. The descendants of some of these, notably the Dowlings, Mackays and Hookes, still live in and around Dungog. Others, such as John Lord, went bankrupt or, as did Myles, sold out early and moved to Sydney.[citation needed]\r\nDungog High Sch',0,-32.403867,151.757171),(1708,'Flat Tops','2420','Lower

It is immediately adjacent to its twin town of Forster, which is the larger of the two towns.\r\nThe region\'s local cinema, Great Lakes Cinema 3, is based on the Tuncurry side of the bridge.\r\nBecause of its close driving proximity to Sydney, Forster-Tuncurry has established itself as a popular summer holiday destination, where in the hotter months, the population swells considerably. The school holidays in the colder months also bring large numbers of holidaymakers.\r\nTuncurry\'s Nine Mile Beach is a popular swimming, surfing and fishing spot. Tuncurry Rockpool is a shark netted swimming enclosure, formed by breakwalls which mark the entrance to Wallis Lake. Tuncurry\'s lakefront areas are characterised by wharves and jetties which provide mooring for fishing boats and pleasure craft.\r\nThe first land grant in this area was in 1875. The settlement was originally called North Shore and then North Forster and was renamed Tuncurry meaning \"plenty of fish\"\"\"\" in 1891 and then proclaimed a village in

It is best known as the location of the infamous Kinchela Boys Home. The village is named after Kinchela Creek, which in turn may have been named after John Kinchela, Attorney General of New South Wales who arrived at Sydney in 1831. The Kinchela Aboriginal reserve was gazetted in 1883, Kinchela was gazetted as a village in 1885 or 1886, and in 1892 an Aboriginal school was established at Pelican Island, near Kinchela.[1]\r\nKinchela Boys Home was established by the Aboriginal Protection Board in 1924 and absorbed the Aboriginal school. The home was intended for Aboriginal children who were removed from their families as part of the process of \'assimilating\' them into white Australian society. The victims of this process eventually became known as the Stolen Generation. Kinchela Boys Home housed between 400 and 600 boys between 1924 and its closure in 1970.[2] Bringing Them Home, the report of the National Inquiry into the Separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children from their Families, documents the brutal punishment and sexual abuse suffered by these boys.\r\nOne of a pair of gates that originally formed the front gates of Kinchela Boys Home is now in the collection of the National Museum of Australia. A group of men, who had all been Kinchela boys, officially handed the gate over to the museum at a small ceremony in Kempsey in 2012. As part of the museum\'s collection, the gate will represent the stories of the Kinchela boys\' experiences.[2]\r\nKinchela Boys Home Aboriginal Corporation (KBHAC) was established in 2001 after some former Kinchela Boys Home inmates asked World Vision Australia to assist them in reuniting boys who had spent time at the Kinchela home and help them develop an organisation for the all former inmates and their families. KBHAC seeks \'... to reconnect members of the Stolen Generations to their families, clans and communities. It works to restore and reconstruct cultural identity, pride and self-worth.[4]\r\nIn 1980, Kinchela Boys Home was converted into a drug and alcohol rehabilitation centre (\'Bennelong’s Haven\') for

It was not until 1836 that the village of Wauchope first came into existence. In that year Captain Robert Andrew Wauch (whose father dropped the \'ope\' from the end of his name as a result of a family dispute) paid a deposit on 760 acres (3.1 km2) on King Creek.[2] He bought more property and built Wauch House.\r\nThe following city has been identified as a sister city of Wauchope by Sister Cities International:[8]\r\nWauchope\'s economy was traditionally based on the timber industry. At different stages[when?] in its history, more timber was transported out of Wauchope than out of any other town in Australia (via Wauchope railway station).[4] Timber from Wauchope was used in the construction of the Sydney Opera House.[citation needed]\r\nOn 23 February 2013 floodwaters peaked at 7.22 mAHD at 7.30pm after heavy rainfall in the upper catchment area.[3]\r\nWauchope railway station serves as an interchange for passengers travelling to nearby coastal centres such as Port Macquarie.[7]\r\nTo the east of the main shopping area is the railway line from Sydney. The Hastings dairy and milk factory is located close to the point where the railway line crosses the Hastings River.\r\nWauchope is the location of Timbertown, a popular heritage theme park inspired by the logging industry that formed the basis for Wauchope\'s early economy and prosperity. The town has a population of approximately 7,500 (as of 2006 - including King Creek & Redbank). It has also played an important role in the Hastings Valley dairy industry.\r\nRobert Wauch died in the Macleay area in 1866, and the Government Gazette published the deeds of his properties, specifying that they should be called Wauchope. When the post office opened in a nearby settlement in 1881, it was named Wauchope, although the Government Gazette misprinted the name Wanghope, an error that was not corrected until 1889.\r\nOther important attractions include the historical society, historic buildings, Broken Bago vineyards and natural attractions including state forests and Bago Bluff National Park.[4]\r\nThe township is set out along the southern bank of the Hastings River with the back drop of Bago Mountain further south.\r\nThe 1963 flood, which is notorious for the damage it caused in the lower reaches of the river, is only ranked as the eight highest flood at Wauchope. It reached a peak level at Wauchope of 7.75 mAHD and was considered[by whom?] to be a 1 in 15 year event at Wauchope.\r\nIndustry in and around Wauchope has transformed primarily into farming and tourism. Increasingly, Wauchope and its surrounding villages and farms are becoming known for gourmet produce, including cheeses, wines and organic fruits and vegetables.[citation needed] The Hastings Farmers Markets are held at the Wauchope Showground on the 4th Saturday of every month and showcase a wide variety of local produce.\r\nThe main street is High Street (a small section of the Oxley Highway), running generally westward through the town after coming east from Port Macquarie and across the North Coast railway line. The main street includes the Co-op general store (previously Parkers) and a number of smaller businesses and local bank branches. At the corner of Hastings Street is the local post office. Further up the main street is the town clock, a legacy of the days the town was the centre of the Hastings Shire local government area. Back along Hastings Street is the Co-op supermarket as well as the court house. In 2009 work commenced on the rebuilding of this supermarket. The old building was completely demolished and a much larger and more modern structure was completed and opened in 2010.\r\nWauchope has its own railway station on the North Coast Line of New South Wales. It is serviced by six NSW TrainLink trains per day 3 heading South (to Sydney), 3 heading further north to Grafton, Casino and Brisbane. Passengers can alight at this station for connecting coaches to the nearby Port Macquarie.\r\nTimbertown, the town\'s best-known tourist attraction, is a colonial-era themed village, which is located on the outskirts of Wauchope. It features static displays and attractions such as a working steam train, bullock team, and a Cobb and Co stage coach.[4][5] The Big Bull was a notable tourist attraction between Wauchope and Port Macquarie for twenty years, but was removed in 2007.[6]\r\nThe largest recorded flood in the Hastings River at Wauchope occurred on 13 January 1968 and reached a peak level of 9.1 metres (30 ft) above the Australian height datum (mAHD). The 1968 flood was estimated[by whom?] to be slightly rarer than a 100-year event. The next largest flood was determined to be the flood of 5 to 7 March 1894.

Facilities at the village included a primary school, a railway station, a shop, and a service station. That highway re-alignment resulted in the demolition of the local school, shop and other dwellings.\r\nIn recent years the locality has seen some growth including the construction of a rural fire service outpost. Warrell Creek will undergo further significant change following the completion of a proposed dual-carriage Pacific Highway upgrade starting in 2014/15.[1]\r\nWarrell Creek is a locality on the Mid North Coast of New South Wales, Australia.

The race meetings attract large registered betting interest and many who just come for the spectacle of events such as the Bowra Cup.\r\nNewspapers\r\nThe Nambucca Valley\'s community radio station, 2NVR 105.9FM, focuses on the Macksville, Bowraville, Nambucca Heads and surrounding communities.\r\nThe word Bowra comes from the Gumbaynggirr place name, Bawrrung, which possibly means cabbage tree palm.[4] Other definitions given have been \'bullrout fish\', \'scrub turkey\' or \'bald head\'.[5] Originally named Bowra, the ville was added to the name in the 1870s to avoid confusion with the Southern Highlands town of Bowral.\r\nBy the 1880s the district was also an important dairy and pig raising area. Timber began to decline as the dominant industry by the early 20th Century, as the supply became rarer.\r\nLike many businesses in country towns at the time of its construction, the theatre operated as a racially divided business. Aborigines had to buy their tickets separately, enter the theatre by a separate side entrance, sit in inferior seating below an interior partition and were permitted to do so only after the program had begun.[8] As a result, the theatre was a stop-off on the 1965 Freedom Ride which saw students from Sydney University tour regional NSW to highlight racism against Aboriginal people.\r\nThe town invites some tourists with such things as a folk museum, a war museum, a historic theatre, and other historic features. It also invites new residents with its scenic beauty and idyllic lifestyle. The Bowraville Jockey Club holds regular race meetings, and this also invites visitors from neighbouring towns and afar.\r\nThe Bowraville Theatre has become a popular tourist attraction on the Mid North Coast hinterland. Built in 1940 as a picture theatre, it was derelict for many years but now operates as a performance space for the local theatre group, writers group, choir, and in its traditional role as a cinema.\r\nBetween 1990 and 1991, three children were murdered in Bowraville. Despite two trials and much publicity, there have been no convictions for the murders.\r\nTelevision ABC, ABC2, SBS, SBS NEWS, PRIME COFFS HARBOUR (SEVEN), SOUTHERN CROSS TEN (TEN), NBN (WIN, NINE)\r\nThe local community brought the theatre back to life, through volunteer work and fund raising. The restored foyer was opened at the end of 2002 and on Friday 29 August 2003, the Bowraville Theatre re-opened its doors. The indigenous community held a smoking ceremony and performed a welcome dance.[7]\r\nIn March 1841 Clement Hodgkinson explored the upper reaches of the Nambucca and Bellinger Rivers. He was the first European to make contact with the local Aboriginal communities. The township grew up in the 1850s and 1860s.\r\nThe town remained relatively static throughout the 20th Century but by the 1980s this area of the New South Wales coast was attracting people looking for a better lifestyle. Today this is apparent in venues like the beautifully restored historical theatre in the main street.\r\nOn 5 November 2011 Bowraville was honoured as the Winner of the Cultural Heritage Award and came third overall in the Tidy Towns Awards by Keep Australia Beautiful - Tidy Towns.

The Gumbaynggirr lands cover an area of the Mid North Coast from the Nambucca River to as far north as the Clarence River (Grafton), west to Armidale and eastward to the Pacific coast.[3] The area was mostly subtropical rainforest until the arrival of Europeans.\r\nThe town was gazetted in 1870 and Bowraville Post Office opened on 1 August 1870.,[6] and became the main centre of the Nambucca Valley. Its early industries were mainly timber and dairy, and the town eventually came to inherit the Nambucca Shire Council chambers. From about the 1960s, however, Bowraville began to decline in popularity and wealth.\r\nWhite settlement began in the area with the timber-getters. The first timber-getter into the area was Mr William Scott (after whom Scotts Head is named). The most popular timber was by far red cedar, of which there are now few trees left. Hoop pine was also popular. Like many Australian timber towns of this era, the town thrived for several decades, and by the 1870s boasted two hotels, several general stores, a blacksmith\'s, tailor, post office, a school and a number of churches.\r\nMany jobs have been lost in recent years with the decline of the timber industry however agriculture has diversified from the traditi',0,-30.641900,152.854557),(2085,'Buckra Bendinni','2449','Coffs Harbour','Coffs Harbour -

Its elevation is 609 metres (1,998 ft) above sea level. It is situated on the Great Western Highway and has a railway station (opened in 1868 as Buss\'s Platform)[2] on the Main Western railway line served by NSW TrainLink\'s Blue Mountains services. At the 2006 census, Woodford had a population of 1,967.[1]\r\nWoodford is well known to mountain bike riders and walkers as the start point for the renowned Oaks and St Helena tracks. It is also the finish point for Andersons and Ingar fire trails, also popular with mountain bike riders and walkers. Each June or July, Careflight International raises money by conducting the Woodford to Glenbrook Classic, a cycling and running race from Woodford railway station to Euroka picnic area at Glenbrook in the Blue Mountains National Park. The Classic follows the Oaks and Bennetts Ridge fire trails, and is 25 km in length.[4]\r\nRuins at Gypsy Pool, Wilson Glen\r\nA centenary time capsule was buried at Woodford Railway Station on 14 December 2002 by Chris Parr, Woodford\'s station master at the time. He collected items from the locals which went into the capsule to be opened in a hundred years.\r\nMural at Woodford Station\r\nThe area also presents opportunities for bushwalking and photography in places like Murphys Glen and Wilson Glen (on the south side) and Mabel Falls Reserve (on the north side).[5]\r\nGiant Mountain Blue Gum near Woodford, over 70 metres tall\r\nThe site was originally known as Twenty Mile Hollow. In the 1830s an inn called The Woodman was built there. Ten years later the inn became known as the King\'s Arms, later popularly known as Buss\'s Inn after 1855. Sydney businessman Alfred Fairfax converted the building into a private home some time later and renamed it Woodford House. The railway station adopted the name Woodford in 1871.[3] Woodford House later became [www.nationaltrust.org.au/places/woodford-academy], a private boys\' school and is now a heritage-listed building.',0,-29.487538,153.132525),(2290,'Angourie','2464','Clarence Valley','Coffs Harbour - Grafton','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-29.481012,153.359964),(2291,'Freeburn Island','2464','Clarence Valley','Coffs Harbour - Grafton','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-29.401544,153.332154),(2292,'Micalo Island','2464','Clarence Valley','Coffs Harbour - Grafton','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-29.431524,153.312481),(2293,'Wooloweyah','2464','Clarence Valley','Coffs Harbour - Grafton','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-29.483013,153.342381),(2294,'Yamba','2464','Clarence Valley','Coffs Harbour - Grafton','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-29.437064,153.361445),(2295,'Yuraygir','2464','Clarence Valley','Coffs Harbour - Grafton','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-29.621867,153.315914),(2296,'Harwood','2465','Clarence Valley','Coffs Harbour - Grafton','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-29.418833,153.240867),(2297,'Iluka','2466','Clarence Valley','Coffs Harbour - Grafton','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-29.407475,153.350886),(2298,'The Freshwater','2466','Clarence Valley','Coffs Harbour - Grafton','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-29.357290,153.349022),(2299,'Woody Head','2466','Clarence Valley','Coffs Harbour - Grafton','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-29.369351,153.366522),(2300,'Banyabba','2469','Clarence Valley','Coffs Harbour - Grafton','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-29.338403,153.002402),(2301,'Bean Creek','2469','Clarence Valley','Coffs Harbour - Grafton','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-28.618977,152.590462),(2302,'Bingeebeebra Creek','2469','Clarence Valley','Coffs Harbour - Grafton','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-28.815242,152.786879),(2303,'Bonalbo','2469','Clarence Valley','Coffs Harbour - Grafton','NSW','Media related to Bonalbo at Wikimedia Commons\r\nBonalbo township later developed on a part of McIntyre\'s holding which fronted on to Peacock Creek. However, the depression of the 1890s drove a number of selectors away, including McIntyre who sold his land to Paddy McNamee. New selectors appeared in the 1900s when McNamee proved the land was arable and when sawmills opened up west of the range. By 1910 there were about 100 selectors in the area living on densely timbered land and with no roads to facilitate access to the wider world. Land was purchased from McNamee and the township was established in 1911 with McNamee building and owning the butcher\'s shop, hotel and billiard room. He may also have built the post office and hall.[citation needed]\r\nBonalbo is a very pretty little town, with amenities which are attractive to retirees.[citation needed] The village has a hospital, ambulance station, chemist, supermarket, a Newsagency & service station, a pub with motel rooms, a bowling and recreation club featuring a challenging nine-hole golf course and tennis courts. All amenities are within walking distance of the centre of town. Jacqui Lawrence, a slalom kayaking Olympic Silver medalist,[when?] attended Bonalbo Central School.[citation needed]\r\nIn the 1920s, a railway branch line was intended to connect Casino with Bonalbo, but construction was abandoned due to the advent of the Second World War. Historically the town\'s economy was supported by dairy farming and the timber industry, however both the sawmill and milk factory have been closed for several decades. The current population of the town and surrounding area\'s is around 500 people.[citation needed]\r\nThe first European settler in the area was J.D. McLean, a Scots settler who drove his sheep up from the Hunter Valley in 1841 when the depression struck. He established the \'Bunalbo\' or Duck Creek run and later became a major pastoralist and the treasurer of Queensland. The Robertson Land Acts of 1861 opened the territories up to free selectors (small landowners) but it was not until 1887 that the first, Donald McIntyre, took up a section of the old station, although the Robertson family had selected various sections themselves, possibly prior to 1880. It was at this time that cedar-getters first moved into the area.[citation needed]\r\nBonalbo, a rural village in the Northern Rivers region of New South Wales, Australia, is located 815 kilometres (506 mi) north-east of Sydney. In the 2011 census, Bonalbo and the surrounding area had a population of 543.[1] The town\'s name derives from the Gidabal word bunawalbu meaning \"bloodwood trees\"\"\"\".[2]\"\"\"',0,-28.736470,152.622832),(2304,'Boomoodeerie','2469','Clarence Valley','Coffs Harbour -

The busy Pacific Highway passes through the centre of town. Woodburn is 712 km north of the state capital, Sydney, and 34 km south of the regional city of Lismore.\r\nPrior to the arrival of European settlers in the 1840s, the Woodburn area - known as Maniworkan to the Indigenous inhabitants - was the home of the Bundjalung people. Woodburn was an important river port until the decline in river transportation along the Richmond led to a decline in the town\'s own fortunes. Today, the income associated with the town\'s position on one of Australia\'s major highways is important to the local economy, as are the fields of sugar cane surrounding the town. The tourist resort of Evans Head is 10 km south-east of Woodburn.\r\nWoodburn is part of the Richmond Valley Shire, the administrative headquarters of which is in nearby Casino.\r\n',0,-29.071010,153.345695),(2401,'Doonbah','2473','Richmond Valley - Coastal','Richmond - Tweed','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-29.086621,153.375933),(2402,'Evans Head','2473','Richmond Valley - Coastal','Richmond - Tweed','NSW','Evans Head is named after a marine surveyor, Lt Evans, RN who carried out the first marine survey of the coastline in the area.[2]\r\nThe town\'s airport, the Evans Head Memorial Aerodrome, formerly a RAAF base. The Evans Head Memorial Aerodrome is heritage listed and will always be known by that name.\r\nNSW Trainlink operates a daily coach between Grafton and Byron Bay via Evans Head.\r\nBallina Buslines operates one route to Ballina via Woodburn: 660\r\nEvans Head is a town in Richmond Valley Shire of the Northern Rivers region of New South Wales, Australia. At the 2011 census, Evans Head had a population of 2,722 people.[1] It is 726 kilometres north of Sydney, and 11 kilometres east off the Pacific Highway from Woodburn.\r\nThere is a prawn fishing fleet permanently moored in the estuary. Other industries include tourism and there is some sugar cane growing further inland.\r\nThe town was traditionally a fishing village, with snapper fishing and prawning forming the basis of the town\'s local economy. With rising costs and diminishing prawn catches, the local trawler industry has diminished dramatically.[citation needed] The town has an industrial estate, \'The Bowlo\' bowling club, RSL club, Surf Club and the \'Illawong\' hotel. Evans Head is home to one of the largest holiday parks in NSW, parts of which are pet friendly. The Evans Head Holiday Park (formerly known as \'Silver Sands Caravan Park\' ) has almost 600 sites and is located within walking distance of all the local town amenities. The town has two supermarkets, two butchers, a number of clothing stores, and other eateries who cater for the tourist population. Whilst the population is less than 3,000 people that number swells in holiday periods.\r\nIt is a coastal town and a holiday resort, playing host to one of the largest holiday parks in NSW. It is sandwiched between two national parks, the Bundjalung National Park and the Broadwater National Park. There is a wide curved beach that is popular for fishing, surfing and swimming. The 1874 wreck of a timber schooner, Pilot, is visible on the beach north of the town in times of high erosion.[3] Evans Head also plays host to one of the few retired F-111 aircraft in Australia. In addition the museum has a host of authentic aircraft on display.\r\nNorthern Rivers Buslines operates two route from Lismore: 690 and 695, where the 695 also continues to Grafton from Evans Head',0,-29.115680,153.429065),(2403,'Iron Gates','2473','Richmond Valley -

Port Kembla','Illawarra','NSW','In the past, Port Kembla\'s industrial heart was associated with significant industrial pollution including emissions of nitrogen oxides and other dangerous gases. However, the air quality around Port Kembla has improved dramatically over the past decade. At nearby Kembla Grange the average concentration of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) measured by the NSW Department of Environment Climate Change halved between 2002 and 2014.[18]\r\nBack in the 1990s health problems were associated with noxious gases. One 1998 study of the industrial areas of Newcastle and Port Kembla found \'an important association between relatively low levels of particulate air pollution and respiratory symptoms\' among primary school children.[19] Fallout has also introduced elevated levels of lead and other heavy metals to the soil around Port Kembla and has formed thick deposits in many buildings and industrial structures.[20]\r\nA copper smelter and refinery, the Electrolytic Refinery and Smelting Company of Australia, began production in 1908, followed by the opening of Metal Manufactures in 1917 and finally the arrival of the Hoskins Iron and Steel Works in 1927. The works became Australian Iron and Steel the following year.\r\nPort Kembla was home to one of Australia\'s tallest industrial chimneys, a 198 metre tall chimney built in 1965. Port Kembla Primary School was once located adjacent to it but was closed down due to pollution problems from the chimney including lead contaminated soil, acid rain and soot. A warning alarm was fitted to warn of high toxin levels. In November 2008, the Port Kembla stack was inspected and confirmed to have concrete cancer.[13] The stack was planned to be demolished in early 2010 at a cost of A$10 million.\r\nPremier Illawarra runs three routes to and from Port Kembla railway station:[12]\r\nGun position No. 2 at Illowra Battery, which formed part of the Kembla Fortress defences in World War II\r\nPort Kembla is known for the BlueScope Steel steelworks operations on Springhill Road and throughout North Port Kembla. Other notable industrial operations in the suburb are: Port Kembla Coal Terminal, Port Kembla Copper, Port Kembla Port Corporation, Incitec, Adstream Services, Port Kembla Gateway and GrainCorp.\r\nHome grounds are Kully Bay Park.\r\nA foreshore park located in walking distance from Port Kembla Beach. Used in summer for Port Kembla Cricket Club home games.\r\nPort Kembla\'s highest point, Hill 60, overlooks the Five Islands and Red Point. Hill 60, originally the site of an Aboriginal settlement, was used by the army during World War II to make a coastal gun emplacement known as Illowra Battery. In September 1942, Aboriginal inhabitants were forcibly evicted from the area.[7] It has remained in the army\'s ownership and is now a public lookout reserve, despite a vigorous campaign to return some of the land to its Aboriginal owners. Although not technically open to tourists, the tunnels are open, and can be explored by foot. The entrance to the tunnels is located almost under the coastguard tower on Hill 60, and can be seen down the left when standing at the information board, facing southeast.[8]\r\nBoth stations have a one sided platform, with the platform at Port Kembla used for terminating trains. The stations are served by approximately one train per hour, usually a local service to Thirroul, but extra direct trains to and from Sydney are provided in the peak hours.\r\nA popular take off area for hang gliders and para gliders, Hill 60 Park has BBQ facilities as well as picnic shelters, seats and tables positioned to enjoy the scenic views.\r\nPort Kembla has a railway station on the Port Kembla branch of the South Coast Line. It is the terminus of the branch line, and serves the residential area of the suburb of the same name. The station has one side platform, used for terminating trains. It is served by approximately one train per hour, usually a local service to Thirroul and Waterfall, but extra direct trains to and from Sydney are provided in the peak hours.\r\nA small sheltered beach at the bottom of Hill 60\'s eastern side facing the Five Islands Nature Reserve.\r\nPort Kembla has a warm oceanic climate (Cfb) with humid summers and mild, crispy winters. The suburb enjoys abundant sunshine, getting 111.4 clear days, annually.\r\nPort Kembla North Station\r\nAlso known by locals as MM Beach for its close proximity to the Metal Manufacturers site on Gloucester Boulevard. Remnants of a tidal rock pool are still standing near the southern end of the beach below the headland.\r\nPort Kembla Station\r\nOn 2 August 2013, it was announced that the stack would be demolished on Friday 6 September 2013.[15] Due to asbestos concerns, the demolition was delayed. After no signs of danger were found, a new date was announced for the demolition; 20 February 2014.[16]\r\nBy 1947 the town\'s population has increased to 4,960 with smaller satellite suburbs such as Cringila and Lake Heights, mushrooming on its fringes.[4] That year, 1947, marked the',0,-34.479473,150.901651),(2715,'Berkeley','2506','','','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-34.481408,150.844147),(2716,'Coalcliff','2508','Illawarra Catchment Reserve','Illawarra','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-34.243453,150.976081),(2717,'Darkes Forest','2508','Illawarra Catchment Reserve','Illawarra','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-34.214374,150.950643),(2718,'Helensburgh','2508','Illawarra Catchment Reserve','Illawarra','NSW','The town is on the Woronora Plateau. It is separated from Otford to the south by a high hill and Otford Road. It is separated from Waterfall by tight twists of railway descending from the South Coast Line\'s highest point at Waterfall to Helensburgh Station. To the south of the line are the two segments of the Garrawarra State Conservation Area, managed by the Office of Environment and Heritage, Parks and Wildlife Group, and to the north the Royal National Park. Waterfall is considered Sydney\'s most southern suburb and the city train service stops here. Correspondingly, Helensburgh is the northernmost suburb of the Wollongong Local Government Area and is considered the northernmost point, politically, of the Illawarra region, though geographically this is generally considered to be Bald Hill. Helensburgh has an uncrowded, friendly, carefree, and close-knit community with proximity to the beach and overall quiet, unpolluted bush surroundings.\r\nWeather conditions in Helensburgh are generally fairly mild throughout the year, much like the majority of the New South Wales coast. Day temperatures average between 24°C and 29°C in the summer months, and rarely go above 33°C. Average day temperatures during winter months are between 6°C and 12°C, and rarely dip below 2°C. Night temperatures tend to be much cooler, dropping off anywhere from 10 to 20 degrees after the sun goes down.\r\nHelensburgh is traditionally a Labor-voting area, as from the late 1950s a large amount of public housing and large unit blocks were erected. Many of these have been removed or purchased privately. The town is now part of the federal electorate of Cunningham, held by Labor\'s Sharon Bird, and the state electorate of Heathcote, held by Liberal MP Lee Evans.\r\nThe reason for this microcosm of climate lies in Helensburgh’s altitude. Although it doesn’t appear to be particularly mountainous, Helensburgh is surrounded by coastal suburbs located virtually at sea level, while Helensburgh itself, due to an odd quirk of geography, is not. So while you would expect Helensburgh’s weather to be more similar to Sydney’s or Wollongong’s, given their relative closeness to the north and the south, the fact that Helensburgh is around 250 metres higher above sea level than either of them does have a noticeable effect on its climate and weather patterns.\r\nHelensburgh often seems like it has its very own climate compared to neighbouring locations, with visitors to the area often commenting that Helensburgh seems to be a couple of degrees colder than Sydney or Wollongong on the same day (especially in winter). Helensburgh also has a higher rainfall than its neighbours, although locals would claim that the difference between Helensburgh’s rainfall rate and Sydney’s or Wollongong’s rainfall rates seems greater than what official sources would indicate it to be. Commuters can often be heard to complain about seeing clear blue skies in every other suburb on a rainy day in Helensburgh.\r\nEast of Helensburgh is the locality of Lilyvale a one time mining community, now mostly part of the Royal National Park. Lilyvale once had a railway station but this was closed after mining ceased in the area. A mural depicting miners is at the starting point of the old line.\r\nHelensburgh is surrounded by the bushland of the Royal National Park, the Garawarra State Conservation Area and the water catchment of the Woronora Dam and adjacent Heathcote National Park, so is environmentally sensitive, though picturesque and naturally bound. This bushland location also makes Helensburgh susceptible to damage from frequent summer bushfires. The dry sclerophyll bush is home to several walking tracks and lyrebirds are not uncommon nearby. The Helensburgh Skate Park opened in July 2007.\r\nOriginally called Camp Creek, it was established as a workers\' camp in the 1880s to accommodate coal miners, who worked in the coal mine in the area. Helensburgh Post Office opened on 1 December 1886.[2]\r\nThe duplicated curved platform is a rare remainder of early railways. The old Helensburgh railway station was covered in earth until recent years but has been partially uncovered for historical purposes. The old railway line was serviced by steam trains. [3]\r\nOn the flip side, extreme weather conditions affecting Sydney or Wollongong generally aren’t felt in Helensburgh. In recent years, several famously severe hailstorms and/or windstorms in both Sydney and Wollongong all left Helensburgh virtually untouched.\r\nOne of the most popular local events is the annual Helensburgh Lions Club Fair which is held in the month of October and is attended by the majority of the locals every year. Other local events include the Holy Cross and Helensburgh Primary School Fetes are well supported by the community. The Sri Venkateswara Hindu temple holds festivals and special days.\r\nFor the most part, Helensburgh reflects Australia’s reputation for mostly fine weather, with moderate average temperatures, and wetter summer months',0,-34.190675,150.981985),(2719,'Lilyvale','2508','Illawarra Catchment Reserve','Illawarra','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-34.196076,151.011359),(2720,'Maddens Plains','2508','Illawarra Catchment Reserve','Illawarra','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-34.274844,150.940312),(2721,'Otford','2508','Illawarra Catchment Reserve','Illawarra','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-34.213259,151.003235),(2722,'Stanwell Park','2508','Illawarra Catchment Reserve','Illawarra','NSW','Lawrence Hargraves - Aviation pioneer who lived in Stanwell Park and completed much of his most famous research and experiments in the village\r\nOne of the villages most famous attractions is the curved railway viaduct over Stanwell Creek Gorge. It was built in the 1910s when problems with the old railway route forced the construction of a new track higher up the mountainside. At 65 m above the creek bed, surrounded by profuse rainforest vegetation and containing an estimated five million bricks, it is the largest railway viaduct in Australia.\r\nWalking tracks include the Stanwell Tops lookout track which runs from Stanwell Park train station up the hillside to the Peace Garden, where there are historic Aboriginal carvings on the trees, and to the Stanwell Tops Lookout. Another track, the Wodi Wodi, Bullock, or Mount Mitchell Track, leads from the former track down to Stanwell Creek, around the viaduct and up Mount Mitchell, then down to the railway and a carpark on Lawrence Hargrave Drive. On the Wodi Wodi track, an aboriginal drawing of a whale can be seen, as well as several middens. Access to Bald Hill from Stanwell Park is available from a track on Chellow Dene Avenue, leading to the top of the hill.[2]\r\nStanwell Park is a picturesque coastal village and northern suburb of Wollongong, New South Wales, Australia. It is the northernmost point of the Illawarra coastal strip and lies south of Sydney\'s Royal National Park. It is situated in a small valley between Bald Hill to the north, Stanwell Tops to the west and Mount Mitchell to the south. It has two lagoons from the village’s two creeks, Stanwell and Hargrave Creeks and a beach running between headlands. Like other towns in the region the village is known colloquially known as TFOE, this is an acronym for the postcode (2508).\r\nThe area was originally inhabited by the Wadi Wadi Aboriginal group. It was first traversed by 3 shipwrecked sailors in an epic journey of survival along hundreds of miles of coastline until rescued at Wattamolla, north of Stanwell Park. Two of their companions were unable to negotiate the Coal Cliffs where the Sea Cliff Bridge is today, and their remains were found by explorer George Bass, who also reported on the rich coal seam apparent in the cliffs.\r\nElemont - Australian hip hop artist who originated from the village.\r\nIn the 1980s a fatal accident occurred on the railway due to cliff erosion.\r\nJoe Hockey - Former Australian treasurer lived in the village\r\nKalani Ball - A professional surfer who originated from the village.\r\nThe valley continued to attract notable people: Major Sir Thomas Mitchell, one of Australia\'s best-known explorers built the first house at Stanwell Park; Supreme Court Judge John Fletcher Hargrave later owned and holidayed in the area, his inheritance coming to Lawrence Hargrave, one of the world\'s most important aviation pioneers of the 1890s in the lead-up to powered man flight. He performed his most important experiments at Stanwell Park. Lawrence Hargrave moved to Hillcrest House, having inherited it from his brother Ralph Hargrave, in 1893. It is on the road up to the Stanwell Park railway station.\r\nFlukey - DJ originating from the village\r\nJust east of the Symbio Wildlife Gardens, on Lawrence Hargrave Drive, is a turnoff that leads to Sri Venkateswara Hindu Temple. Australia\'s first Hindu Temple opened on 30 June 1985. It is located in Temple Street on a 2.6 hectare site. This site was chosen because it fitted the Hindu requirements of a peaceful spot, close to water, elevated, in the bush and on virgin soil. Indian architect Janakiramana Sthapati designed the temple, his family have been temple architects since the sixth century.\r\nNow Stanwell, or The Park, is home to about 1200 people, a dormitory suburb for commuters to the nearby cities of Sydney and Wollongong, and a popular tourist destination.\r\nAnother attraction is Kelly\'s Falls, which includes a viewing platform.\r\nStanwell Park was the name given to the farm established on the grant given to Matthew John Gibbons in 1824. He was given most of the area called Little Bulli which included present-day Stanwell Park and Coalcliff. The whole of Northern Illawarra went under the Aboriginal name Bulli which means rising up, about the only thing one can do along the narrow coastal strip and indentations of Northern Illawarra. Bulli remains the name of an Illawarra suburb further south of Stanwell Park.\r\nMadi Fogg - A professional model who originated from the village.\r\nThe village has a small area of shops and an art gallery on Lawrence Hargrave Drive. Bushwalking is possible on several tracks, most notably the Wodi Wodi Track that climbs Mount Mitchell from the station, and a rather degraded track to Stanwell Tops Lookout, also from the station.\r\nAt Bald Hill is Intabane Mansion, a prominent feature visible from the valley below with a \'witches hat roof\', used as an army lookout during World War II.

It was named the Scarborough Hotel at the time, before the name stuck to the town itself. The South Clifton (Scarborough) Mine was opened in 1891 by the Illawarra Coal Company, and closed in 1921. A new adit was established about 2 kilometres further south and this came to be known as South Clifton Tunnel Colliery.[3] From 1898 to 1908 a post office was operated at the railway station. In 1913 construction began on a Clifton-Scarborough public school, and finished in 1914. It was opened by the Minister for Education of the time. From 1 January 1915, the Clifton Public School was renamed Scarborough Public School. In 1952, an employee at South Clifton Tunnel Colliery, says that the mine was under the control of the Operations Branch of the Joint Coal Board who were in the process of upgrading to enable it to supply the new Tallawarra Power Station then being built.[3] In 1954 mechanical pillar extraction of coal commenced at Scarborough. In 1963 the jubilee of the school was celebrated.\r\nScarborough hosts a number of surfing competitions. It has a railway station and Scarborough Public School is the town\'s public primary school. The town used to be called South Clifton but in 1903, to avoid confusion between the railway stations, it was renamed. The escarpment behind Scarborough is approximately 300 metres above sea level.[2]\r\nScarborough is home to the [2] Northern Suburbs Rugby League Club] known as the Bulldogs. The Bulldogs\' home ground is the Jim Allen Oval located in Monash St, the same road as Scarborough Beach.

Batemans Bay is administered by the Eurobodalla Shire council. The town is situated on the shores of an estuary formed where the Clyde River meets the Tasman Sea, opening into a bay of the same name.\r\nThe local newspaper for Batemans Bay and the Eurobodalla region is The Bay Post; published by Fairfax Media.[19]\r\nThe town is not thought to have taken any real form until 1841 and the arrival of the Innes family. Fleeing Ireland, the family came in search of the legendary indigenous potato, and after a failed attempt at running mashed potato barges to the burgeoning Sydney market, exploited the areas plentiful seafood to establish Australia’s 3rd fish and chip shop - one which stands to this day. The Illawarra and South Coast Steam Navigation Co found the Clyde River to be navigable in 1854. Regular services by the company in the 1860s and 1870s contributed to growth of the district.[10]\r\nA 2013 estimate put the population of the greater urban area at 17,500.\r\nIt is the closest seaside town to Canberra, making Batemans Bay a popular holiday destination for residents of Australia\'s National Capital. Geologically, it is situated in the far southern reaches of the Sydney Basin.[3] Batemans Bay is also a popular retiree haven, but has begun to attract young families seeking affordable housing and a relaxed seaside lifestyle. Other local industries include oyster farming, forestry, eco-tourism and retail services.\r\nThe population of Batemans Bay has shown continued growth, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics:\r\nThe traditional custodians of the land surrounding Batemans Bay are the Indigenous Australian Yuin people of the Walbunja clan. The traditional language spoken by the Walbunja people is Dhurga. A number of sites in the region are considered culturally significant to the Aboriginal peoples.[4]\r\nOn 22 April 1770, European explorer Captain James Cook first sighted and named the bay. Cook gave no reason for the name, which may commemorate either Nathaniel Bateman, the captain of HMS Northumberland when Cook was serving as her master from 1760–62,[5] or John Bateman, 2nd Viscount Bateman, a former Lord Commissioner of the Admiralty in the 1750s.[6]\r\nDaily newspapers such as The Canberra Times, the Illawarra Mercury from Wollongong, the Sydney Morning Herald, the Daily Telegraph, The Australian, The Age, Herald Sun and the Australian Financial Review are available in Batemans Bay. Some local newspapers from other NSW South Coast towns such as Bega, Nowra, Ulladulla, Moruya, Merimbula and Narooma are also available.\r\nBatemans Bay is located on the Princes Highway (Highway 1) about 280 kilometres (170 mi) from Sydney and 760 km (470 mi) from Melbourne. Canberra is located about 151 km (94 mi) to the west of Batemans Bay, via the Kings Highway. At the 2011 census, Batemans Bay had a population of 11,334[1] with surrounding communities including Long Beach, Maloneys Beach and the coastal fringe extending south to Rosedale bringing the total population of the urban area to 15,773.[2]\r\nIn May 2016, an estimated 120,000 bats suddenly descended upon and swarmed the town, prompting the town to declare a state of emergency. Due to the fact that they were flying foxes, they had to be removed using non-lethal methods, including smoke, noise, lights and removing vegetation.[12] The town received AUS$2.5 million in order to relocate the bats.[13]\r\nThe village of China Bay was surveyed in 1859. Oyster farming commenced in 1860. By 1870, there was a fleet of 40 oyster boats. A sawmill was erected in 1870. The port was proclaimed in 1885. A ferry service across the Clyde ran from 1891 until the bridge was opened in 1956. In 1942 during World War II, a trawler was attacked by a Japanese submarine between Batemans Bay and Moruya.[11]\r\nThe other networks broadcast ten additional digital-only channels: 7Two, 7mate, GO!, GEM, ABC2, ABC3, ABC News 24, SBS Two, One HD and Eleven.\r\nBatemans Bay and the Eurobodalla region receive five free-to-air television stations (digital) including two government funded networks:\r\nSBS offer digital high-definition simulcasts of their main channel, SBS ONE on SBS HD.\r\nThe ABC (ABC1), the SBS (SBS ONE) and three commercial networks:\r\nBatemans Bay experiences an oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification Cfb). The climate of Batemans Bay is moderated by the sea, with warm summers and mild sunny winters. Nights can be cold in winter. Thunderstorms mostly occur between November and March, with rainfall maximums in summer. The town gets 87.3 clear days annually.\r\nA colonial vessel, Fly, was driven into Batemans Bay by bad weather during 1808. Local indigenous Australians attacked her crew; resulting in three fatalities from the Fly.[7] In 1821 Lt Robert Johnston entered the bay and explored the lower reaches of the Clyde River on board the cutter Snapper.[8] Snapper Island within the bay is named aft',0,-35.708152,150.174704),(2825,'Benandarah','2536','South Coast','Capital Region','NSW','Not yet

The busy Pacific Highway passes through the centre of town. Woodburn is 712 km north of the state capital, Sydney, and 34 km south of the regional city of Lismore.\r\nPrior to the arrival of European settlers in the 1840s, the Woodburn area - known as Maniworkan to the Indigenous inhabitants - was the home of the Bundjalung people. Woodburn was an important river port until the decline in river transportation along the Richmond led to a decline in the town\'s own fortunes. Today, the income associated with the town\'s position on one of Australia\'s major highways is important to the local economy, as are the fields of sugar cane surrounding the town. The tourist resort of Evans Head is 10 km south-east of Woodburn.\r\nWoodburn is part of the Richmond Valley Shire, the administrative headquarters of which is in nearby Casino.\r\n',0,-35.375596,150.378783),(2875,'Woodstock','2538','Shoalhaven','Southern Highlands and Shoalhaven','NSW','Kelton, J.

At one time there were several sidings near the station with grain silos, stock yards, loading bank, goods shed, hay stage, and loco platform. In the 1980s services were suspended between Cowra and Blayney. The section was re-opened by the Lachlan Valley Railway which runs heritage trains from Cowra to Blayney. The railway station is now an art gallery and private residence.\r\nGold was discovered in 1868 at Woods Flat, a few kilometres south of Woodstock. A rush of 500 diggers took up the ground there, but after a short period only a few were left as surface gold was minimal and water supplies lacking. The goldfield had a long history but today almost nothing remains of the buildings at Woods Flat. The village of Woodstock was established in response to the building of the railway line north of Woods Flat, from Blayney to Cowra in 1880s. Initially known also as Woods Flat, the name of the village was changed to Woodstock in 1886.[3]\r\nBy 1900 there were many commercial businesses in the villages including butchers, bakers, hotels, saddleries, smithies, bootmakers, mercers, tailors, motor vehicle garages and billiard rooms. A post office was operating by 1897. The current Royal Hotel was rebuilt in 1911, an earlier timber building having been destroyed by fire. The Commercial Banking Company of Sydney opened a branch at Woodstock in 1907, followed by the Commonwealth Savings Bank in 1913 and the Bank of New South Wales in 1929. The Soldiers Memorial Hall was opened in 1925 by Sir Neville Reginald Howse, who was at that time the Member for Calare.[4]\r\nCountry markets are held at Woodstock Soldiers Memorial Hall on the second Sunday of each month except January. The Memorial Hall hosts a touring opera company, OperaWorks, each year. Other events at Woodstock include a long track motorbike championships and the annual show.\r\nThe bushranger John Vane, a member of Ben Hall\'s gang, who died in 1906 was buried in an unmarked grave at Woodstock cemetery. A headstone was erected by local historians in 1989.\r\nMedia related to Woodstock, New South Wales at Wikimedia Commons\r\nWoodstock is a village in the central west of New South Wales, Australia, 21 kilometres (13 mi) east of Cowra. It contains remains of a brief goldrush during the late 19th century which left behind a number of substantial buildings before the village relapsed into relative isolation.

It is located approximately 180 kilometres by road south from the state capital Sydney and 20 kilometres south of the commercial centre of the City of Shoalhaven, Nowra in the County of St Vincent. The village is eight kilometres inland of the western shores of Jervis Bay.[1] Its population in August 1996 was 410.[2]\r\nSince the last sawmill closed in the mid 1980s and the main south coast road bypassed in 1995, the village, whilst quieter, has increased in population and dwellings. Its precinct (now Hawken Road) is still dominated by the School of Arts, Public School, Post Office, Church and the volunteer Rural Fire Service building. The School of Arts has a busy patronage with private and community events. A new Rural Fire Service building was opened in 1991 opposite the Union Church that, whilst undergoing major repairs in 2000s, has seen little use since 1993. The Public School was the subject of a major building program in 1995 and remains the major employer in the village. Volunteer organisations are an important part of village life with members active in P&C, Rural Fire Service, the Forum (a Community Consultative Body active with the local Council) and the School of Arts. Other bodies have been organised as required; such as the Friends of Tomerong Union Church, that organised the Church\'s restoration; the Shoalhaven Unwanted Tip Campaign (ShUT), that successfully lobbied to prevent a local shale quarry from being used as a non-putrescible waste dump; and the Sesquicentenary Committee organising celebrations for the primary school\'s 150th celebrations.\r\nThe first recorded European exploration of the area around Tomerong probably occurred when Lieutenant James Grant of the Lady Nelson ventured inland from Jervis Bay up to 13 kilometres in 1801.[4][5] Land grants occurred around Jervis Bay and St Georges Basin in the 1830s and 1840s with the first Tomerong land sale occurring at Nowra on 8 May 1855.[6] Settlement increased as the a bridge was constructed across Falls Creek and the development of the main south coast road provided transport and mail services. The Travellers Rest Hotel was opened in 1857 to service the travelling public and, five years later, a Post Office and School were established.[7][8][9] Both celebrated their 150th (Sesquicentenary) anniversary in 2012. A Church was constructed in 1877 and a General Store commenced operation about 1882, but it was the development of the timber industry (from 1815 for cedar and from about 1860 for hardwood) that saw Tomerong\'s importance grow, just as farming had started to wane.[10][11] For the next 100 years the industry was so important to the village that it resulted in the headquarters of the Clyde Shire being constructed in 1908.[12] A School of Arts was constructed in 1926 and remains a popular venue for entertainment, not only for the locals.[13] The consolidation of sawmills saw local enterprises reduce in the 1960s and 1970s and the bypassing of the village in 1995 by the Princes Highway meant the village became more attractive for family living adjacent to the growth areas of St Georges Basin and Huskisson/Vincentia.[6]\r\nWith a history of farming and sawmilling, the village and its environs is now primarily low to medium density residential, providing easy access to tourist areas such as Huskisson on Jervis Bay and the commercial centre Nowra. West and south west of the village the land is predominantly State Forests and Crown Land adjoined by the Morton National Park.[3]\r\nThe village is 48 metres above sea level and is overlooked to the north by Tomerong Hill at 111 metres. The settlement is concentrated on a north to south spur of this hill which runs two kilometres down to Tomerong Creek 20 metres above sea level. A ridgeline, of about 100 metres above sea level, located two kilometres west of the village runs generally north to south. Creeks north east of the village generally drain to Currambene Creek and Jervis Bay, whilst those to the south generally run to St Georges Basin. The village lies near the southern extremity of the Sydney Basin with the higher areas to the north and west comprising Nowra Sandstone that thins to the south and east to reveal Wandrawandian Siltstone.

The school is renowned for its success in state and national competitions with students ranked as winners or finalists in academic, sporting and cultural activities. In the year 2000 it was the National Winner and NSW State Rock Eisteddfod Premier Division Champion. Nowra Anglican College is a K-12 school as well in Bomaderry, it is well known for its success in all aspects of school achievements. Bomaderry Public School is the main primary school in the area with over 250 students.\r\nBomaderry has several facilities and activities available for people living in the Shoalhaven area, such as community groups, sporting facilities, bush tracks, a theatre company which offers classes and productions to the community the train station and a small shopping district in the heart of the town.\r\nOne of the first houses in Bomaderry was Lynburn which still exists today. It was built in 1895 by the architect Howard Joseland[3] for Jane Morton, the widow of Henry Gordon Morton, the manager of the Shoalhaven Estate. A photo shortly after its construction is shown. The road over the bridge in the photo is now the Princes Highway where it crosses Bomaderry Creek.\r\nAfter the town opened in 1892 several factories moved into the area. Messrs Denham Bros. built a bacon and ham factory in about 1900.[4] A milk condensery opened in 1901 which was originally located near the railway station[5] but later moved to the bank of the Shoalhaven River close to Bolong Road.[6] In 1912 the Nowra Co-op Dairy Company established a milk Depot at Bomaderry[7] and this was a major boost to the local economy for many years.\r\nBomaderry township was opened in 1892.[2] It was previously part of the Shoalhaven Estate owned by David Berry whose brother Alexander Berry had built a road to the area in 1858. When David died in 1889 the estate was sold in portions. The subdivision plans for Bomaderry are shown. In 1893 the railway was extended to Bomaderry and the town began to grow from this time.\r\nIts railway station is the terminus of the South Coast railway line, which is part of the NSW TrainLink network.\r\nBomaderry is a town in the Shoalhaven council district area of New South Wales, Australia. In 2006, it had a population of 6,601 people.[1] It is on the north shore of the Shoalhaven River, across the river from Nowra, the major town of the Shoalhaven, of which Bomaderry is locally regarded as being a suburb.',0,-34.855412,150.608383),(2967,'Nowra','2541','Shoalhaven','Southern Highlands and Shoalhaven','NSW','According to the 2006 census, 87.9% of the population of Nowra was born in Australia, with North-West Europe being the most common birthplace of immigrants at 7.5% of the population. 6.1% of the total population are Indigenous Australians. There are 11,386 households in Nowra. There are a total of 8,248 families, with 2,838 containing two Adults with children under 15 and/or dependent students, and 1,163 being one parent families with children under 15 and/or dependent students.[8]\r\nThe population of Nowra - Bomaderry was 35,920[1] at 30 June 2015 having grown consistently since 2005 when the estimated population was 31,716.[1]\r\nIt is also located near Berry, Jervis Bay, Kangaroo Valley, Culburra Beach, Greenwell Point, Huskisson, Shoalhaven Heads and Cambewarra.\r\nA major landmark in the area is the house Bundanon, which began as a single-storey weatherboard structure built about 1840. In 1866, a two-storey sandstone house, made of locally quarried stone, was built immediately in front of the weatherboard house. The sandstone house features timber verandahs and is now listed on the Register of the National Estate.[5]\r\nArcher was an Australian thoroughbred racehorse who won the first and the second Melbourne Cups in 1861 and 1862. He won both Cups easily, and is one of only five horses to win Melbourne Cup twice or more, and one of only four horses to win two successive Cups. Archer was trained in the Nowra area.\r\nThe four major codes of football in Australia are all popular in the Nowra area. Rugby union is represented by the Shoalhaven Rugby Club, the team plays out of Rugby Park in South Nowra. The club won the 2008 premiership in the Illawarra district competition, and has produced international and provincial players such as Andrew Walker and Alex Kanaar. Australian rules football is played by four clubs from the Shoalhaven area, with the Nowra Blues playing at West Street Oval, Albatross Demons at Tom Smith Oval, and the Bomaderry Tigers at Artie Smith Oval. Further south, the Bay and Basin Bombers play at the Leisure Centre at Vincentia. These four clubs are all members of the South Coast AFL, fielding junior and senior teams. Rugby League has traditionally been represented by the Nowra Warriors and Bomaderry Swamprats. However, at the end of 2007 these teams merged to form the Shoalhaven Jets Rugby League Football Club. The Shoalhaven Mariners were established in 2006 and represent the area in the sport of baseball. The team plays home matches out of Fred Finch Park in Berkeley, Wollongong. Baseball has a new venue at the South Nowra Soccer Complex.[10] The Shoalhaven Tigers represent the area in the New South Wales State Basketball League and have won several championships from 1988 until 2007.[citation needed]\r\nWith the warmest month\'s mean being just 22°C (71.6°F), Nowra has a humid subtropical climate (Cfa) under the Köppen climate classification, making it the southernmost city on the coastal strip to be within this climate zone, albeit an isolated one — Nearby coastal cities to the north, such as Wollongong and Kiama, have an oceanic climate (Cfb) as their warmest month\'s mean doesn\'t reach the 22°C threshold.[6]\r\nNowra is on the Shoalhaven River, which formerly hosted the Australian National wakeboarding championships, it is also a popular fishing location. The river divides Nowra from Bomaderry and North Nowra, and is bridged by the historic Nowra Bridge. The Shoalhaven river is a salt water river, although the river itself does not flow into the sea. The Shoalhaven River meets the sea through the canal that joins the Shoalhaven and Crookhaven Rivers, which was dug by convicts under direction of local entrepreneur and pioneer Alexander Berry.\r\nNowra /ˈnaʊərə/ is a town in the South Coast region of New South Wales, Australia. It is located 160 kilometres (99 mi) south-southwest of the state capital of Sydney (about 120 kilometres (75 mi) as the crow flies.) With its twin-town of Bomaderry, Nowra had an estimated population of 35,920[1] as at June 2015. It is also the seat and commercial centre of the City of Shoalhaven. Geologically, the city is situated in the southern reaches of the Sydney basin. [2]\r\nThe Nowra region, south of Bomaderry Creek was inhabited by the Wodi-Wodi tribe of the Yuin nation while north of Bomaderry Creek was inhabited by the Dharawal Aboriginal people prior to European arrival. Around 1824, ex-convict Mary Reibey applied for a land grant in the Burrier area, on the southern side of the Shoalhaven River. The Nowra township was officially recognised in 1852. Less than ten years later, in 1861, a postal service was established. Also in that year, the racehorse \'Archer\', trained in Nowra by Etienne de Mestre, won the first Melbourne Cup. By 1885, Nowra was declared a town.[3]\r\nThere are two hospitals in Nowra, the Shoalhaven District Memorial Hospital, a hub for Oncology services, and Nowra Private Hospital.\r\nThere are two

from Camden, and especially after the railway arrived in 1863. Picton is the only town in the Southern Hemisphere where you can pass through it twice when travelling by train.[4] It was established as Stonequarry in 1841 and was renamed Picton in 1845. It remained a stopping point on the Great South Road, later renamed the Hume Highway, until it was bypassed in December 1980.\r\nPicton railway station is on the Southern Highlands line with a relatively infrequent service with trains running every 30m (peak) – 2 hours (off peak).\r\nThe George IV Inn, reputedly constructed in 1839, is considered to be one of the oldest hotel buildings in Australia. The cellar contains remnants of convict shackles as prisoners being transported from Sydney to Berrima prison would often be held in Picton overnight. The barn behind the hotel may date back to 1810 and is possibly the oldest building in Picton - it is used for functions such as birthday and engagement parties. The hotel is also the location of Scharer\'s Little Brewery, one of the first microbreweries in Australia and winner of numerous awards for its Burragorang Bock and Scharer\'s Lager beers.\r\nPicton also has both senior and junior rugby league and soccer teams.\r\nPicton is a small town in the Macarthur Region of New South Wales, Australia, in the Wollondilly Shire, on the south-western edge of Sydney. The town is located 80 kilometres south-west of Sydney, close to Camden and Campbelltown. It is also the administrative centre of Wollondilly Shire.\r\nPicton was first explored by Europeans in 1798 and remained beyond the limits of legal settlement until 1821. Following the discovery of good land in the interior and the settlement of Bong Bong and the Goulburn areas, Governor Macquarie authorised the building of the new Great South Road between Sydney and the Southern Highlands in 1819.[2] This opened up the Picton area to settlers, including Henry Colden Antill,[3] who established a 2,000-acre (8.1 km2) property in 1822.[2]\r\nThe viaduct is still in use by the railways. Ghost tours are conducted in some of the historic buildings and inside the disused railway tunnel on Redbank Range, where residents and visitors claim to have experienced paranormal activity. The abandoned tunnel was used to store mustard gas spray tanks during World War II.[6]\r\nBushfires destroyed several homes in the Nangarin Estate located on the western outskirts of Picton, from a fire front originating from Lakesland in September 2006.[5]\r\nPicton has a humid subtropical climate (Cfa) with hot summers and cool winters.

The Gunning Wind Farm has been established to the town\'s northeast, and is visible from the Hume Highway.\r\nUniting Church, Gunning\r\nOld Gunning Court House\r\nGunning was originally a coach stop, and service centre for the surrounding farms mainly growing Merino sheep. It has a police station and court house, post office, and school.\r\nThe Main South railway from Sydney arrived in 1875 and was completed through to Albury in 1882. Gunning railway station is served by one daily NSW TrainLink XPT service in each direction operating between Sydney and Melbourne, and one weekly Xplorer service operating between Sydney and Griffith.[2]\r\nIts main streets were built very wide, for the time of horse and bullock-drawn wagons. This served the town well when the main highway between Sydney and Melbourne carried cars and trucks through, until the Hume Highway by-pass was completed on 5 April 1993. The town has been able to resume a more rural pace of life, and develop something of an industry in providing bed and breakfast accommodation.\r\nThe region (specifically Gundaroo) was first explored by Europeans in 1820, and settled the next year by Hamilton Hume. In 1824, Hume and William Hovell left here to discover the overland route to Port Phillip Bay where Melbourne is sited. Land sales began in 1838.

The Galong deposit was first mined in 1885 with significant mining activity in the 1920s producing burnt lime or quicklime, which is used in the production of cement. The mine re-opened in the 1960s and again in 1994. In 2001, the lease was altered to extend the mineable area of land from 16 to 160 hectares (40 to 395 acres); resources of 20 million tonnes of limestone have been defined within the proposed limit of mining. In 2003, the mine was acquired by Boral. It now produces lime for agricultural lime used for farming canola and grains; agricultural lime is used for remediating soil acidity, a major problem threatening the productivity and sustainability of agriculture in many parts of the state. It produces approximately 300,000 tons per year, about one quarter of the requirements for the state of New South Wales. Apart from agricultural purposes, a major consumer of lime from Galong is the Port Kembla steel works. A kiln was built at the mine in 2003/04 to allow the production of quicklime for use in cement. The mine employs about 19 people.[4][5][6]\r\nGalong is a village in New South Wales, Australia, in Hilltops Council.

As gold became scarce, European miners began to resent what they saw as the greater success of the more industrious Chinese, and hence many Chinese miners were attacked, robbed and killed. The anti-Chinese rebels rallied in numbers of up to 3,000. Eventually the rioters were controlled, Chinese miners had their claims restored to them, but the New South Wales Parliament passed the Chinese Immigration Bill which restricted the number of Chinese that could be brought into New South Wales on any ship and imposed a tax per head on entry.\r\nIn 1889 Young was the first town in Australia to install electricity into the streets and homes of the township, Tamworth NSW installed electricity to the streets only the previous year.\r\nFollowing the connection to the South West Tablelands Water Supply Scheme, which provided water from Burrinjuck Dam, the railways ceased to draw water from Chinamans Dam after 1936.

Chinamans Dam, with an initial capacity of over 9,100 cubic metres (2×10^6 imp gal) when it was in railway use, is situated at a very small place called Pitstone on Sawpit Gully. The story goes that the dam was built in the 1860s by Dutch brothers, Herman and John Tiedemann, to provide water for the sluicing of their Victoria Hill gold claims. At some time in the 1870s, the brothers sold the area, including the dam, to a Chinese group who worked the site.\r\nOn census night, 7 August 2001, there were 6,821 people (3,287 males and 3,534 females) counted in Young. There were 238 people (1.221%) (127 males and 111 females) who identified as being of Indigenous origin in the 2001 Census. The median age of people in the 2001 Census was 36 years\r\nThe dam was a popular spot for swimming.

Yass','Capital Region','ACT','Tharwa is in a different geological structural unit than the rest of Canberra, being on the Cotter Horst. The village itself is built on Tharwa Adamellite. This adamellite is coarsely foliated and contains biotite mica. It has been dated at 423 ±6 million years old. This places it in the upper Silurian age.\r\nTharwa Bridge, opened on 27 March 1895, crosses the Murrumbidgee River. Tharwa Primary School was opened soon after, in 1899. The Tharwa township narrowly avoided being burnt in the 2003 Canberra bushfires. The Tharwa community is currently facing two further challenges: closures and repairs to Tharwa Bridge due to extensive rot in its supporting timbers discovered in 2005 and the 2006-07 Australian Capital Territory budget announcement of its plans to close the Tharwa preschool and primary school at the end of 2006.\r\nThe village is located on the banks of the Murrumbidgee River and at the junction of Tidbinbilla and Naas Roads, and Tharwa Drive. The main public buildings are a general store, a preschool and primary school (now closed), Saint Edmund\'s Anglican Church, a cemetery, a community hall and tennis courts. The annual Tharwa Fair was hosted by the school, and was held in May until 2006. The Tharwa Fair is now organised by Tharwa Preschool.\r\nTharwa (postcode 2620) is a small village within the Australian Capital Territory, 35 kilometres (22 mi) south of Canberra, the capital city of Australia. At the 2006 census, Tharwa had a population of 109.[1]\r\nMagnetic declination at Tharwa is 11.817 deg east, total field strength is 43108 nT and magnetic inclination is -66.031 degrees; as at 1 March 2006.\r\nDeclination is increasing by 0.004 degrees per year. Inclination is increasing by 0.016 degrees per year (as in the rest of Canberra).\r\nTharwa is the oldest official settlement in the Australian Capital Territory, proclaimed a settlement in 1862. Tharwa was named after the Aboriginal word for Mount Tennent, a nearby mountain peak which is part of Namadgi National Park. Mount Tennent was named after John Tennant, who was one of the earliest and best-known bushrangers in the region. Tennant lived in a hideout on the mountain behind Tharwa from which he raided local homesteads 1827–1828, before being arrested and transported to Norfolk Island.\r\nTharwa Bridge was reopened for light traffic (less than 5 tonnes) in August 2008.[2] Tharwa Bridge was reopened for public use on Friday 24 June 2011 following the completion of the restoration works. Restoration works took two years and involved removal of the old bridge deck and barrier railings as well as installation of new cross girders and sway braces to the permanent trusses.[3]\r\nThe outcrop area is extended to the north north west to Freshford, and includes Castle Hill. It goes as far to the west as Sawyer\'s Gully. To the south it goes close to Angle Crossing, and on the east side is bounded by the Murrumbidgee Fault.

NSW Trainlink operate multiple direct services from both railways stations to Canberra, Sydney, and provides connections across the state. Murray\'s coach services operate daily between Bateman\'s Bay and Canberra including picking up and setting down passengers in Braidwood.\r\nBraidwood is a town in the Southern Tablelands of New South Wales, Australia, in Queanbeyan–Palerang Regional Council. It is located on the Kings Highway linking Canberra with Batemans Bay. It is approximately 200 kilometres south west of Sydney, 60 kilometres inland from the coast, and fifty-five from Canberra. Braidwood is a service town for the surrounding district which is based on sheep and cattle grazing, and forestry operations. At the 2006 census, Braidwood had a population of 1,108.[1]\r\nThrough much of the 20th century, Braidwood was essentially in rural recession. Amongst other consequences, very little building work was carried out, and as a result the town entered the 21st century with much of its original streetscape and architecture intact. On 30 March 2006 the town and its setting were listed on the NSW State Heritage Register, following a period of unpleasant dispute between those wishing to preserve the town\'s charm and those wishing to develop it.\r\nBraidwood was the subject of Australia\'s first Royal Commission in 1867, inquiring into the activities of police officers and managers in the district, concerning the extent to which bushrangers had been shielded and assisted by police connivance and inactivity. The Commission identified several instances of misconduct and found the superintendent of police had failed to exercise \'strict and proper control over his men.\'[3]\r\nThe town has several times been used for film locations, including Robbery Under Arms (1920), Ned Kelly (1970), The Year My Voice Broke (1987), On our Selection (1995), Finding Joy (2003), The Discontinuity (2009) and Australia\'s Most Haunted (2013).\r\nA memorial and large pine tree mark the site of Wilson\'s grave, from which there are views of the town. The path to the grave is open to the public the path and is through a series of paddocks intersected by gateway sculptures and installations by local artists. At the moment, (June 2010), the path is not open to the public. It is recommended to check the status of the path at the tourist information center in Wallace Street, which is the main street of Braidwood.\r\nThe town was named after Dr Thomas Braidwood Wilson.[2] He had been a surgeon-superintendent of ships taking convicts to New South Wales and Van Diemen\'s Land (now known as Tasmania). He was first granted land in Van Diemen\'s Land in 1824, which he exchanged for land near Lake George in 1825. In addition he was given 2560 acres (10 km²) which he selected in the \'new country\' on two tributaries of the Shoalhaven, Monkittee and Flood creeks. In 1833, the western end of Wilson\'s grant was resumed and reserved for a future village and a similar area added to the eastern end in compensation. Wilson settled in the district in late 1836 with his wife and family. He became a community leader and amongst other things contracted to build the first courthouse in 1837-38. In 1840 Wilson petitioned the government to build a road from Braidwood to Huskisson to enable faster and cheaper shipping of the wool clip to Sydney and, with Col. John Mackenzie, supplied the materials and labour for the Braidwood to Nerriga section.\r\nIn 1841 Braidwood Farm had 141 residents. Wilson was sent bankrupt due to a drought in the late 1830s and the subsequent depression. He died in November 1843. His land was sold for £2,000 to John Coghill, who now owned all the land on the south, east and north of the town. Coghill built the historic house Bedervale. However, before his death, Wilson had purchased the block immediately to the north of Braidwood. He was buried on this block, high on the hill overlooking the town.\r\nEuropean explorers reached the district in 1822 (Kearns, Marsh and Packer). The area was first settled by Europeans in the 1820s, and the town was surveyed in 1839. The village was located near the headwaters of the Shoalhaven River.\r\nBraidwood was formerly the seat of the Tallaganda local government area. However, following restructuring of local government areas by the New South Wales Government, it is now part of Queanbeyan-Palerang Regional Council. The local paper is now called the Braidwood Times.\r\nGold was discovered in 1851, and for the next two decades the district\'s population swelled to about 10,000. Supplies and produce to support the workforce on the gold fields came from as far afield as the Canberra region,[4] (though Canberra itself would not be founded until 1913). This prosperity lasted for several years, during which some substantial commercial buildings including banks and hotels were constructed.',0,-35.437701,149.800868),(3510,'Budawang','2622','Queanbeyan','Capital Region','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-35.444285,149.966099),(3511,'Bulee','2622','Queanbeyan','Capital

Severe thunderstorms are semi-frequent in summer and due to the towns elevation can carry large quantities of hail.[21]\r\nCooma has a population of 6,301.[1] Cooma is the main town of the Monaro region. It is 800 metres (2,620 ft) above sea level.

It lies at the confluence of Australia\'s two most important rivers, the Darling and the Murray, the latter forming the border with the state of Victoria to the south. The border with the state of South Australia lies approximately 100 kilometres (62 mi) to the west. The town of Wentworth is in the local government area of the same name.\r\nDuring the late 1800s Wentworth was an important river port; however, like many such towns, its significance faded with the development of the railways (railroads).\r\nConfluence of the Darling with the Murray River\r\nWentworth is now an important tourist outback destination and provides a welcome break for those travelling to or from Broken Hill. In addition to its authentic outback charm, the town offers some interesting attractions:\r\nThe Great Wentworth Tractor Rally is a commemoration of the grey Fergie tractors that were used to maintain the levee banks and save the town from the 1956 Murray River flood.[4]\r\nWentworth was a popular destination for \'pokie tour\' bus rides from Adelaide, the capital city of South Australia, prior to the legalisation of poker (gambling) machines in that state.[citation needed]\r\nSemi-arid countryside; roadside rest stop 20 km north of Wentworth\r\nMoorna Post Office opened on 22 February 1855 and was renamed Wentworth in 1860.[2]\r\nThe town has been flooded many times by the two rivers. The most significant was in 1956, when both rivers flooded simultaneously. Local farmers, supplemented by the army and navy, worked for months to build levee banks to hold the water out of the town.[4]\r\nRoadside sculpture, Wentworth, NSW, Australia\r\nIn 1876 Wentworth township was described in the following terms:\r\nThe town has an Australian rules football team competing in the Sunraysia Football League.[5]\r\nIn 1902, the people of Wentworth were lobbying for a railway from Mildura to be built, including a bridge over the River Murray.\r\nWentworth is situated on the Darling, about half a mile from the junction, and is plainly visible from the Murray. The township is built on rising ground, and, save in very exceptional seasons, is quite out of reach of flood waters. The population is between 400 and 500. The place appears prosperous and progressive. The trade up the Darling River, and the supply of stores to the stations in the vicinity, form the life-blood of its prosperity. Wentworth possesses a custom-house – a hideous little building resembling a watch-house, and as great an eyesore as the cause of its establishment is an inconvenience and annoyance to trade. The other public buildings are a post and telegraph office, for Wentworth is on the main telegraph line to Adelaide, and a court-house and offices, which are also used for land offices. There is a resident police magistrate, Mr. Richardson ... The two churches in Wentworth are buildings creditable to the town. The Roman Catholic Church is a brick structure, the Protestant Church an edifice of brick and stone... There are three or four stores of considerable size, and several hotels. The Australian Joint Stock Bank has a branch here. The river, which, opposite the town is about the width of the Murray at Echuca, is crossed by a punt.[3]\r\nNamed after the famous explorer and politician William Charles Wentworth, the town is 34 kilometres (21 mi) to the west (via the Calder Highway) of the Victorian regional city of Mildura. The famous mining city of Broken Hill is 266 kilometres (165 mi) to the north along the Silver City Highway.',0,-34.106868,141.919215),(3745,'Laurel Hill','2649','Tumut - Tumbarumba','Riverina','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-35.600390,148.093100),(3746,'Nurenmerenmong','2649','Tumut -

A major labour strike in the 1930s gained national coverage. The open cut pit was at one time the largest in the Southern Hemisphere. Mining eventually went underground and continued through to the late 1980s. The tin mine was reopened in late 2001, particularly for alluvial mining, but closed in mid-2004 after Marlborough Resources was placed under voluntary administration due to disappointing results at its new processing plant, poor tin price hedging results, and lower-than-expected tin reserves.[7] Rehabilitation of the open cut pit is yet to occur.

In 1895 West Wyalong was developed 5 kilometres (3 mi) from Wyalong around the bullock track, without the benefit of town planning, resulting in curious kinks in the road where it avoided trees. As well as the mines, the White Tank water supply was located here. This is now the location of McCann Park[3] The goldfield was declared the most productive in the colony in 1899.[3]\r\nCommonwealth Bank\r\nAs mining declined West Wyalong became the main service centre for agriculture in the surrounding district, although for many years there was rivalry between the towns. Both towns wanted the Temora railway line, but settled on a compromise of a station midway between the two towns, called Wyalong Central.\r\nMedical Hall\r\nElders Office\r\nWest Wyalong Federation House\r\nWest Wyalong Anglican Church\r\nBank of New South Wales\r\nPost Office Hotel\r\nCWA Hall\r\nThe population has stabilised recently. This is due, in part, to the Cowal Gold Mine adjacent to Lake Cowal, 45 km northeast and Pace Farm\'s egg production facility.\r\nThe West Wyalong district is the largest cereal-growing centre in NSW. Eucalyptus oil production started in 1907 and the West Wyalong area became one of the major world exporters of the product.\r\nLeadbetter Motor Garage\r\nAmbulance Station\r\nMedia related to West Wyalong, New South Wales at Wikimedia Commons\r\nWest Wyalong Rural Bank\r\nWhite Tank Hotel\r\nWest Wyalong Roman Catholic Church\r\nGlobe Hotel\r\nThe town\'s rugby league team competed in the Maher Cup.\r\nWest Wyalong is a town in New South Wales, Australia, which is the main town of the Bland Shire, located in the Central West region of New South Wales.[2] It is located 467 kilometres (290 mi) west of Sydney.

Berrigan is in the Berrigan Shire local government area and contains the Berrigan Shire Council offices. At the 2011 census, Berrigan had a population of 922.[1]\r\nPopular sports in Berrigan include Australian rules football (the town has a team competing in the Picola & District Football League), netball, golf, bowls, and tennis. Horse racing is also popular, with the Berrigan Gold Cup — held on the same day as the Victoria Derby — attracting a large crowd.\r\nOnce a thriving town with four pubs and the golf club, it has since been reduced to two pubs and the club.\r\nBecause of its location near the border with Victoria, Berrigan was one of the pioneers in the push for an Australian Federation. It was at the suggestion of the Berrigan Australian Natives\' Association that the first meeting of the Federation League was held. Due to its centrality, the meeting was held in Corowa.[5]\r\nMedia related to Berrigan, New South Wales at Wikimedia Commons\r\nIt is also the birthplace of the New South Wales Rural Fire Service.[6]\r\nThe Berrigan Canola festival is held annually in early September. Also held annually is the Berrigan Agricultural Show - Sunday of the October long weekend. It is also close to the Murray River communities of Barooga and Tocumwal.\r\nThe aging population is well catered for in such a small town, with world class hospice and respite facilities provided. While the town thrives on the farming income generated in the district, it is a very modern, and family-friendly town. In 2013, an Alzheimer\'s wing was opened, catering to the numerous residents suffering from the disease.\r\nBerrigan Post Office opened on 11 May 1884.[4]',0,-35.657430,145.812641),(4014,'Boomanoomana','2712','Upper Murray exc.

The town is located on the Silver City Highway, 1,025 kilometres west of the state capital, Sydney and 20 kilometres from the regional centre, Mildura, across the border in Victoria. Part of the Wentworth Shire local government area, at the 2011 census, Dareton had a population of 516.[1]\r\nSchools include Dareton Public School, Coomealla High School and the Coomealla Campus of the Riverina Institute.\r\nDareton had its genesis in 1922 with the recommendation to establish irrigation in the area. Pioneering settlers moved to the district soon after, but it was not until after World War II and the establishment of soldier settler farms that Dareton began to prosper. Dareton is named for the then Water Conservation and Irrigation Commissioner Henry Dare, who was a strong advocate for the irrigation scheme.[3]\r\nMedia related to Dareton, New South Wales at Wikimedia Commons\r\nLocated on the Murray River, the town is at the heart of the Coomealla Irrigation Area. Dareton was once home to an Aboriginal mission, this is now a residential area for Aboriginal people. Australian Test cricket captain Mark Taylor spent part of his early life in Dareton.[2]\r\nDareton today is a producer of grapes and dried fruit. It boasts a championship golf course and is a popular location for fishing and camping.\r\nA major local entity is the Coomealla Memorial Sporting Club. It operates a large gambling and social facility, plus various sporting facilities (including a golf course).

The steamer \'Nangus\' was a 12-horsepower, 70 feet long iron vessel, with two side paddles and towing two iron barges.[83] The \'Nangus\' sank near Wagga after hitting a snag in 1867.[84]\r\nGundagai, perhaps more than any other Australian locality, is referenced in stories, songs and poems. These include Theta\'s poem,\'Ode to the Dead of Gundagai\'.[117] James Riley, \'The Gundagai Calamity\',[118] Jack Moses and others in \'Nine Miles From Gundagai\',[119] Jack O\'Hagan songs \'Where the Dog Sits on the Tuckerbox (five miles from Gundagai)\', \'Along The Road To Gundagai\',[120] \'Snake Gully Swagger\',[121] and \'When a Boy from Alabama Meets a Girl from Gundagai,\'[122] Gundagai also features in the song \'The Grand Old Hills of Gundagai,\'[123] It is referenced in Scottish band Goodbye Mr. Mackenzie\'s song \'Dust\'. A 2010 publication \'Purple Threads\' by Jeanine Leane has won a major literary award, the David Unaipon Award and has been shortlisted for a Commonwealth literary award.[124]\r\nGundagai Aboriginal Elders, Jimmy Clements and John Noble, attended the 1927 opening of the new Federal Parliament House in Canberra by the Duke of York (later George VI.) Jimmy Clements also known as King Billy whose traditional name was \'Yangar\',[31] walked forward to respectfully salute the Duke and Duchess of York (later Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother), and after that the two Elders were formally presented to the Royal couple as prominent citizens of Australia.[32]\r\nGundagai shire is primarily rural, with a small population. Eighty per cent of the shire\'s population live in the town of Gundagai. There are four villages in the Shire: Coolac, Tumblong, Muttama and Nangus, with populations ranging from 40 to 90 people.\r\nEarly in 1879, some Gundagai residents were in fear that the Ned Kelly gang was going to pay the town a visit and while Extra rifles and ammunition to defend the town..[64] were applied for and special constables were sworn in, the Kelly Gang did turn up in the town.\r\nIn 1855 Captain Cadell was aboard the paddlewheel steamer \'Gundagai\' for the first journey in it north of Goolwa,[75] then in 1856 explored the Edward River system as Captain of the \'Gundagai\'.[76] By 1865, the steamer \'Gundagai\' under the command of Captain Cadell, was providing a transport service between Wanganui and the Waitotara in New Zealand, and getting supplies to troops,[77] in support of the British Crown and the Crown\'s involvement in the New Zealand Wars. Captain Cadell became \'Superintendent of Colonial Transport (water)\' for New Zealand.[78] On 25 June 1866 near Patea New Zealand, the little paddlewheel steamer and expert crosser of sandbars, the \'Gundagai\' went onshore and broke in half. All hands were rescued.[79]\r\nThe Shire has been extensively cleared for agriculture and more than 80% of the area is used for dryland cropping and grazing. Less than 1% of the shire is managed for conservation. There are few remaining examples of the original vegetation cover.[6]\r\nThe flood of June 1891 left several pastoral workers and four rescuers who set out in a boat, stranded in trees just to the south of Gundagai. Edward True dragged a light skiff several miles over hills to the rescue site and managed to save several men from drowning.[44] True also saved a young boy from drowning in a waterhole in 1887 and was awarded a Royal Humane Society of Australasia bravery award for that rescue as well.

The town is located 823 kilometres south west of the state capital, Sydney and 303 kilometres north west of Melbourne. Situated on the banks of the Murray River across from Koondrook in the neighbouring state of Victoria, Barham had a population of 1,151 at the 2011 census.[1] The town is in the Murray River Council local government area.\r\nThe major industries in and around Barham are agriculture, including dairying and citrus, and forestry. Like much of the southern Riverina, the town is attuned culturally to Victoria, reading Victorian newspapers and watching Victorian television channels. The most popular team sport is Australian rules football, the town in conjunction with neighbouring township Koondrook across the Murray having an Australian Rules football team competing in the Central Murray Football League.[5]\r\nThe history of white settlement begins in 1843 when the 114,656 acre \'Barham\' station was taken up by Edward Green, who named it after the maiden name of his wife.[3] The south bank of the Murray was then settled towards the end of the Victorian gold rush where squatters grazed sheep & cattle. The typical Australian struggle between squatters (on vast acreage) and selectors (who took up small lots) was played out throughout the district, with selectors such as Parkman, McConnell and Hudson moving in to take up small farms within the Barham station lease from 1877.\r\nGolfers play at the Barham Golf and Country Club on Moulamein Road.[6]\r\nBarham is the birthplace of Australian cyclist Michael Rogers.\r\nFrom the early 1870s, timber cutters began to set up camps and log the River Red Gums (Eucalyptus camaldulensis) that grow in the surrounding forests. Koondrook, on the Victorian side, developed more quickly than Barham, soon becoming the centre of a large forest industry with the timber being used to build boats & paddle steamers. Some of these boats are still operating, the paddle steamer Melbourne, built at Koondrook in 1914 is a tourist attraction at Mildura, the Alexander Arbuthnot, built in 1923, & the Emmylou built in 1980-1982 operate in Echuca. The timber industry has continued to supply building timber, garden timber and firewood with several sawmills operating in the area. The Bonum Sawmill, occupying land at the Northern edge of Barham, incorporated several significant value-adding enterprises, such as a kiln, veneering and finger-jointing before closing in 2010 when the New South Wales government closed access to many of the forest areas following many years of drought and poor tree growth.\r\nThe Post Office opened on 1 January 1895.[4] Growth was slow until 1904 with the construction of a lift span bridge designed to allow paddle steamers through.\r\nFor thousands of years before white explorers arrived, the Barapa Barapa people camped, hunted fished and gardened here. Their cooking mounds, scar trees, middens and artefacts can readily be found on private land and throughout the forests. Each nomadic clan had their own territory with exclusive rights to the camping, fishing and hunting. There was some vigorous resistance to the first settlers, but the indigenous population dramatically decreased in the late 1800s, mainly due to disease.\r\nBarham\'s development was aided when a lift span bridge across the river opened in 1904 designed by Sir John Monash. The bridge replaced a punt that was used to ferry people, stock and goods across the river, and allowed road access between the Riverina and the Victorian markets, while permitting the passage of paddle steamers when the middle section was raised. Until it was motorised in 1997 it was operated by a system of weights worked by two men turning wheels. It is still occasionally raised. The bridge is now one of the oldest remaining across the Murray River. A similar bridge was constructed upstream at the same time between Cobram, Victoria and Barooga, New South Wales.\r\nThe region boasts a rich agriculture based on irrigation including rice, sheep, citrus, cereal crops, dairy, walnuts, olives, and beef cattle.',0,-35.630473,144.130423),(4115,'Burraboi','2732','Upper Murray exc.

There is a Custom-house officer here, though I should judge that his avocations were not of an extremely onerous nature, and the township also possesses a post and telegraph office. If the building can be taken as a type of the township, Euston has not a long life before it. The walls appear as if rent apart by an earthquake. The hotels and about a dozen houses constitute the remainder of the township.[5]\r\nAt the 2011 census, Euston had a population of 795 people.[1] Until the irrigation development at Robinvale Euston was the main town in the area.

Then at night they have a 6:30 Church is a casual and contemporary meeting popular with young and old, students and workers, singles and families.\r\nPrior to European settlement, what is now Emu Plains was on the border of the Western Sydney-based Darug people and the Southern Highlands-based Gandangara people, whose land extended into the Blue Mountains. The local Darug people were known as the Mulgoa who lived a hunter-gatherer lifestyle governed by traditional laws, which had their origins in the Dreamtime. They lived in huts made of bark called \'gunyahs\', hunted kangaroos and emus for meat, and gathered yams, berries and other native plants.[2]\r\nThe Parish of St Paul’s Emu Plains was formed and the Church School licensed on 8 November 1848. The first resident rector was appointed in 1856 and the church building consecrated on 16 August 1872. The chancel was added to the original building about 1887. The original rectory and most of the church records were lost on 4 January 1929 in a bushfire.\r\nThe local government primary school is Emu Plains Public School and the high school is Nepean Creative and Performing Arts High School.[7] There is also a Catholic primary school, Our Lady of the Way, and high school, McCarthy Catholic College.\r\nEmu Ferry Post Office opened on 1 April 1863 and was renamed Emu Plains in 1882.[4]\r\nAt the 2011 census, there were 8,097 residents in Emu Plains. Most people (79.7%) were born in Australia and the top other countries of birth were England 5.7%, New Zealand 1.4%, Scotland 0.8%, Germany 0.6% and Netherlands 0.6%. The top responses for religious affiliation were Catholic 30.4%, Anglican 28.5% and No Religion 14.3%. The top ancestries were Australian 31.8%, English 29.1%, Irish 8.6%, Scottish 6.9% and German 2.7%. 88.9% of people only spoke English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Greek 0.8%, Italian 0.4%, German 0.4%, Arabic 0.4% and Dutch 0.3%.[1]\r\nUntil 1963, Emu Plains was part of Blue Mountains City Council but was then transferred to Penrith City Council, where it is currently split between the North and South Wards. At the state level, it is part of the Electoral district of Penrith, represented by Liberal Stuart Ayres. Federally, it is part of the Division of Lindsay, represented by Liberal Party Fiona Scott.[11]\r\nThe services were initially held in the Emu Plains Community Centre, which served the congregation well until the growing numbers meant that the space was no longer sufficient. On 23 October 2005, the services were moved just down the road to Melrose Hall which meets at 9.35am on Sundays\r\nAt the time of the centenary of the church in 1948, the parish was responsible also for branch churches Christ Church Castlereagh and St Thomas’ Cranebrook, and later also included St David’s Llandilo. In more recent times these branch churches have become linked with the parish of Cambridge Park, and Emu Plains has become a single-church parish.\r\nEmu Plains has a number of landmark buildings:\r\nThe removal of river-stones from the Nepean River for concrete and road-base was begun by the Emu and Prospect Gravel and Road Metal Company in the 1880s. A railway siding, which was to be ultimately expanded into a short branch, was first laid in from the Main Western Line at Emu Plains in 1884. Railway operations, which included their own locomotives, continued until 1967, after when only a siding, shunted by Government trains, remained. All railway operations ceased in 1993.[5]\r\nOur Lady of the Way is a part of the Catholic Diocese of Parramatta in Western Sydney. Rev Robert Anderson served between 2004-2014.

Broadband internet supply uses ADSL2, with the Telstra substation located near the general store.\r\nThe suburb consists of mostly semi-rural properties around 5 to 10 acres (40,000 m2) in size. Entry into the suburb is via Grose Vale Road running from Grose Wold to the East, and the village of Kurrajong to the North.\r\nIn the 2011 census, Grose Vale recorded a population of 1,135 people.[1]\r\nSubscription television is by satellite only. Cable television does not yet run to Grose Vale.\r\nGrose Vale has a government primary (elementary) school, Grose View Public School, a community centre hall, a rural fire station located on Cabbage Tree Road, and is served by a Cub and Scout Pack.\r\nWinters can drop to below zero (32 °F) but this is not common. Daytime summer temperatures can reach into the mid 40s (110 + F) and if coupled with low humidity and a strong NW wind the suburb is exposed to an extreme risk of bushfires (wildfires)\r\nThe suburb has no footpaths and only sparse street-lighting.

It is 371 metres above sea level and, like most of the towns in the vicinity, is located on a narrow ridge between two gorges. Winmalee is to the north. Springwood railway station sits between Valley Heights and Faulconbridge on the Blue Mountains railway line.\r\nChrist Church Anglican Church was built on the Great Western Highway from 1888–89, with extensions in the 1960s and 1980s. It was designed by the architect Sir John Sulman, who had a holiday residence at Lawson. Designed in the Victorian Academic Gothic style, the church is the oldest Anglican church building in the Blue Mountains and is heritage-listed.[6] The house originally built as a vicarage, but only used as a private residence known as Southall, is also heritage-listed.[7] The Presbyterian Church building, a sandstone Gothic building located on Macquarie Road, was built in 1895. The Catholic community was originally part of the Penrith parish, but were given their own building in 1892: St Thomas Aquinas Church. The church has since relocated to St Columba\'s grounds, Winmalee.\r\nSpringwood Australia Day Festival, conducted by Lower Mountains Fundraising Events Inc., is held in the grounds of Springwood Public School and involves local entertainers on 2 stages, Food and Market Stalls and Amusement Rides.[23]\r\nDespite its location in the temperate oceanic Blue Mountains region, Springwood has a humid subtropical climate (Cfa). Unlike the upper Blue Mountains area, it generally has mild winters and warm summers. Although Springwood\'s elevation is at 371 m (1,217 ft), its winter nights are warmer than those of Penrith and Richmond in the lower Sydney metropolitan area, which lie on the footsteps of the Blue Mountains. However, unlike these Sydney suburbs, Springwood has a higher annual rainfall amount.[18] Furthermore, Springwood can suffer bushfire damage during the spring and summer months due to it being located in, and surrounded by, a predominant eucalyptus woodland area which encompass the Blue Mountains region.[19]\r\nButtenshaw Park is also a recreational area which hosts an arboretum, play structures and the Springwood Pool.\r\nSpringwood is the largest town in the lower Blue Mountains. According to the 2011 Census, there were 8437 people living in Springwood including 3909 males (46.3%) and 4528 females (53.7%). The majority (80.9%) were born in Australia. The indigenous populace of Springwood is 146 or 1.7% of the total population. The most common responses for religion were No Religion 25.1%, Catholic 23.6%, Anglican 22.5%, Presbyterian and Reformed 4.6% and Baptist 4.1%.[24]\r\nSpringwood has some parklands with bushwalks often leading into wilderness areas. Fairy Dell is located immediately south of the township and has some tracks leading into the Blue Mountains World Heritage area. The Deanei Reserve is another bushland area which is located east of the township and hosts the threatened and endangered Blue Mountains Shalecap Forest. There are also bushland walks in this bushland Reserve.\r\nThe town is serviced by three high schools, Springwood High School, Winmalee High School and St. Columba\'s High School, as well as private and selective high schools in other suburbs. Springwood is also serviced by five primary schools: Ellison Public School, Faulconbridge Public School, Winmalee Public School, Springwood Public School and St Thomas Aquinas Primary School.\r\nThe Springwood area was first occupied by the Oryang-Ora aboriginal clan belonging to the wider Darug aboriginal tribe of the wider Sydney region. Their existence in the area dates back to approx 40,000 years of settlement with many rock carvings & art sites in the area. At the time of settlement the Chief of the clan was Oryang Jack who was drawn by French Artist Pellier (Ref Mitchell Library) Oryang-Ora was also the reference to the area that marked the dividing ridge line between the Darug tribes of the north and the Gundungurra tribes to the south in the Blue Mountains area.\r\nThe Blue Mountains Vietnam Veterans\' Association conducts the largest annual parade and Memorial Service for Vietnam veterans in Australasia[22] at Springwood, on the third Sunday of August, to coincide with the anniversary of the Battle of Long Tan.\r\nIn 1892, James Hunter Lawson built Braemar, a large, single-storey house situated on a sixty-acre property on Macquarie Road. Braemar started as a family residence, but later became a convalescent home, a boarding house, a private home again and a guesthouse. It was acquired by the Blue Mountains City Council in 1974, restored as a Bicentennial project and reopened in 1988. It serves as a community gallery and centre, staffed by volunteers. The local library is housed in a new building behind Braemar.[5]\r\nThe town\'s annual celebration, Foundation Day, occurs in late March to early April.[21]\r\nSummerhayes Park is a public reserve located in Winmalee, whic',0,-33.700645,150.558750),(4295,'Sun Valley','2777','Blue Mountains','Sydney - Outer West and Blue Mountains','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-33.712081,150.592445),(4296,'Valley Heights','2777','Blue Mountains','Sydney - Outer West and Blue Mountains','NSW','Blue Mountains Transit [6] (formerly Pearce Omnibus and later Blue Mountains Bus Company) headquarters and depot are located in Valley Heights.\r\nValley Heights has a railway station on the Blue Mountains Line of the NSW TrainLink intercity network.\r\nA number of rail heritage items in Valley Heights are listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register:\r\nValley Heights is the start of the steeply graded, 1 in 33 (3%) section to Katoomba. The gradient approaching Valley Heights from Sydney is 1 in 60 (1.67%).

At the 2006 census, Woodford had a population of 1,967.[1]\r\nWoodford is well known to mountain bike riders and walkers as the start point for the renowned Oaks and St Helena tracks. It is also the finish point for Andersons and Ingar fire trails, also popular with mountain bike riders and walkers. Each June or July, Careflight International raises money by conducting the Woodford to Glenbrook Classic, a cycling and running race from Woodford railway station to Euroka picnic area at Glenbrook in the Blue Mountains National Park. The Classic follows the Oaks and Bennetts Ridge fire trails, and is 25 km in length.[4]\r\nRuins at Gypsy Pool, Wilson Glen\r\nA centenary time capsule was buried at Woodford Railway Station on 14 December 2002 by Chris Parr, Woodford\'s station master at the time.

The tracks offer scope for many fine bushwalks and views of the Megalong Valley, but in more recent years have deteriorated due to lack of maintenance.[5] Other tracks in the area include Bruce\'s Walk, an old track that was upgraded by bushwalkers and other volunteers in the 1980s. Bruce\'s Walk is located a few kilometres east of Medlow Bath, on the fringes of the Blue Mountains National Park, a huge park that is now a World Heritage Site.\r\nMedlow Bath was connected to the Main Western railway line in 1880, when the station was called Brown\'s Siding.[3] Medlow Bath railway station is now served by the Blue Mountains Line.\r\nMedlow Bath (postcode: 2780) is an Australian small town located near the highest point of the Blue Mountains, between Katoomba and Blackheath.

In the process, they found many artefacts and features, including signs, shelter caves, seats and picnic tables. This part of the track was officially opened on 24 May 1986, by Alderman David Lawton. The opening was attended by 118 people, including Dick Rushton, who was by then eighty years old.[1] (This opening was condemned by the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Mayor of the Blue Mountains City Council.) Other stretches of the track, from Wentworth Falls to Medlow Bath, were also cleared by the volunteers and opened later in 1986.[2] The track, however, is still patchy and largely without signposts, and is not shown on the topographic map for the area.\r\nMedia related to Bullaburra, New South Wales at Wikimedia Commons\r\nOn the south side of Bullaburra, Red Gum Park offers some scope for walks, with tracks starting from De Quency Road and Cottle Road. The main feature of the park is Minnatonka Falls, situated not far from the residential area in Boronia Road. Tracks go by the falls and part of the way down the creek that flows from the falls.[3]\r\nA walking track was constructed through the area in 1931. The Railway Department had agreed to supply electricity to the Blue Mountains Shire Council from the power station at Lithgow and a transmission line was put through from Blackheath to Lawson with a track to provide maintenance access. The authorities then decided to promote this track as a walking trail, which was duly opened on 21 November 1931. The surveyor who planned the track was A.Bruce, as a result of which the track eventually became known as Bruce\'s Walk.

However, from World War II onwards, the track was forgotten and neglected. Parts of the track were also blocked off when the council constructed Greaves Creek dam in 1942 as a local water supply. Much later, however, a local walker named Dick Rushton found a copy of the pamphlet published in 1931 and set out to clear and mark the track. In 1980 he led a party of walkers along the section of track between Bullaburra and Wentworth Falls, and in 1983 he created a written guide to the track.\r\nBullaburra lies west of Lawson, and east of Wentworth Falls.

The area is the site of a coal mine that was developed in the nineteenth century, but which was ultimately unsuccessful. Six adits were driven into the coal seam by Walter Mackenzie and Thomas Garret, circa 1881. A coke oven was built and it was also proposed to build a tramline from Mount Victoria, but it is not known if this ever happened. The leases changed hands a few times over the years, but no work was done after 1908.[11] Around the south and east edges of Asgard Swamp, there are the remains of huts used by the people who worked the mines.\r\nBy the late 19th century, the town had become a prosperous settlement and many private schools, including The School, Mount Victoria, were founded in the area, which become somewhat of a hill station retreat for wealthy Sydney families.[8]\r\nThe railway station, along with Lithgow, is the terminus for the Blue Mountains Line. The town is located at the junction of the Great Western Highway and the Darling Causeway to Bell. The Roads and Maritime Services is at present researching a major upgrade to the Great Western Highway with the view to bypass the township and the steep Victoria Pass down to Little Hartley to the west.[14][15]\r\nMount Victoria contains a number of buildings with historic significance.\r\nAfter the road across the Blue Mountains was constructed a toll bar was opened about 1 kilometre (0.62 mi) east from the present township in 1849 and the area was also known as Broughton\'s Waterhole Toll Bar.[9] Coaches were charged at the toll according to how well sprung they were, ones without springs were not charged as it was believed they would help crush the road surface.[8]\r\nMount Victoria is located on an escarpment plateau extension of Mount York, the site of a camp on the original Blaxland, Wentworth and Lawson crossing of the Blue Mountains in 1813. The area was originally marked as One Tree Hill on an early map dating from 1834 by the Surveyor General, Sir Thomas Mitchell.[8] This is why when the township was established in 1866 it was known as One Tree Hill.[2]\r\nMount Victoria (postcode: 2786) is a small township in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales, Australia. It is the westernmost village in the City of Blue Mountains, located about 120 kilometres (75 mi) by road from the Sydney central business district and at an altitude of about 1,052 metres (3,451 ft) AHD .[8] The settlement had a population of 823 people at the 2011 Census.[1]',0,-33.588561,150.251161),(4316,'Mount Wilson','2786','Lithgow - Mudgee','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-33.503126,150.388368),(4317,'Black Springs','2787','Goulburn - Mulwaree','Capital Region','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-33.840966,149.711027),(4318,'Chatham Valley','2787','Goulburn - Mulwaree','Capital Region','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-33.820288,149.887520),(4319,'Duckmaloi','2787','Goulburn - Mulwaree','Capital Region','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-33.679898,149.964207),(4320,'Edith','2787','Goulburn - Mulwaree','Capital Region','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-33.800214,149.922383),(4321,'Gingkin','2787','Goulburn - Mulwaree','Capital Region','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-33.888788,149.927471),(4322,'Gurnang','2787','Goulburn - Mulwaree','Capital Region','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-34.011316,149.837299),(4323,'Hazelgrove','2787','Goulburn - Mulwaree','Capital Region','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-33.650014,149.893713),(4324,'Jaunter','2787','Goulburn - Mulwaree','Capital Region','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-33.993635,149.887663),(4325,'Kanangra','2787','Goulburn - Mulwaree','Capital Region','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-33.990380,150.104745),(4326,'Mayfield','2787','Goulburn - Mulwaree','Capital Region','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-33.663290,149.780209),(4327,'Mount Olive','2787','Goulburn - Mulwaree','Capital Region','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-33.598187,149.917271),(4328,'Mount Werong','2787','Goulburn - Mulwaree','Capital Region','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-34.085969,149.903856),(4329,'Mozart','2787','Goulburn - Mulwaree','Capital Region','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-33.819672,149.856164),(4330,'Norway','2787','Goulburn - Mulwaree','Capital Region','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-33.760741,149.817231),(4331,'Oberon','2787','Goulburn - Mulwaree','Capital Region','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-33.703856,149.855484),(4332,'Porters Retreat','2787','Goulburn - Mulwaree','Capital Region','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-33.988815,149.760628),(4333,'Shooters Hill','2787','Goulburn - Mulwaree','Capital Region','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-33.895788,149.861766),(4334,'Tarana','2787','Goulburn - Mulwaree','Capital Region','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-33.526572,149.908189),(4335,'The Meadows','2787','Goulburn - Mulwaree','Capital Region','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-33.636550,149.926845),(4336,'Ben Bullen','2790','Bathurst','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-33.219587,150.021733),(4337,'Blackmans Flat','2790','Bathurst','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-33.364149,150.059386),(4338,'Bowenfels','2790','Bathurst','Central West','NSW','Bowenfels was founded in the 1830s to service travellers along the new road to Bathurst, which opened in 1832,[2] following the opening of the Victoria Pass,[6] which sealed the fate of the old Bathurst road in its descent of Mt. York.[7] It was named by Surveyor-General Thomas Mitchell after George Mears Bowen, a former member of his department.[2] The town was the first settlement in the valley and pre-dated Lithgow by 40 years. The railway opened in 1869,[8] and was electrified in the 1950s, although passenger services no longer service Bowenfels station.\r\nBowenfels is a small town on the western outskirts of Lithgow, New South Wales, Australia.\r\nMount Blaxland, a short distance from South Bowenfels, was the furthest point reached by Blaxland, Lawson, and Wentworth on their historic expedition across the Blue Mountains in 1813. Later in that year George Evans followed in the footsteps of the explorers to Mount Blaxland and then headed west[3] to discover the O\'Connell plains and the Bathurst plains.[4] At South Bowenfels, Magpie Hollow Road heads west[5] to Lake Lyell and then on to Tarana and O\'Connell.\r\nToday there are effectively two Bowenfels. Near Lithgow, on the Great Western Highway, is Bowenfels (with the homestead of the valley\'s first settler, Andrew Brown). About a kilometre south is South Bowenfels. Although both are now essentially suburbs of Lithgow, Bowenfels was, in fact, the first settlement in the valley, predating the existence of Lithgow by nearly 40 years.[2]',0,-33.471596,150.124112),(4339,'Clarence','2790','Bathurst','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-33.479311,150.215559),(4340,'Cobar Park','2790','Bathurst','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-33.469948,150.154968),(4341,'Corney Town','2790','Bathurst','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-33.474890,150.177300),(4342,'Cullen Bullen','2790','Bathurst','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-33.303402,150.032518),(4343,'Doctors Gap','2790','Bathurst','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-33.491005,150.176015),(4344,'Ganbenang','2790','Bathurst','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-33.651781,150.135829),(4345,'Hartley','2790','Bathurst','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-33.548476,150.154588),(4346,'Hartley Vale','2790','Bathurst','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-33.535511,150.233807),(4347,'Hassans Walls','2790','Bathurst','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-33.512259,150.149759),(4348,'Hermitage Flat','2790','Bathurst','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-33.479710,150.145293),(4349,'Jenolan','2790','Bathurst','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-33.764050,150.029554),(4350,'Kanimbla','2790','Bathurst','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-33.620702,150.187891),(4351,'Lidsdale','2790','Bathurst','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-33.378535,150.083775),(4352,'Lithgow','2790','Bathurst','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-33.480068,150.157987),(4353,'Little Hartley','2790','Bathurst','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-33.571701,150.208607),(4354,'Littleton','2790','Bathurst','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-33.495525,150.136672),(4355,'Lowther','2790','Bathurst','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-33.624853,150.100331),(4356,'Marrangaroo','2790','Bathurst','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-33.428678,150.106225),(4357,'Mckellars Park','2790','Bathurst','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-33.471560,150.154148),(4358,'Morts Estate','2790','Bathurst','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-33.468424,150.168076),(4359,'Mount Lambie','2790','Bathurst','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-33.455786,149.982580),(4360,'Newnes','2790','Bathurst','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-33.176787,150.236022),(4361,'Oaky Park','2790','Bathurst','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-33.471048,150.178208),(4362,'Pottery Estate','2790','Bathurst','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-33.484868,150.154533),(4363,'Rydal','2790','Bathurst','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-33.492530,150.036915),(4364,'Sheedys Gully','2790','Bathurst','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-33.495736,150.150210),(4365,'Sodwalls','2790','Bathurst','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-33.516429,150.007266),(4366,'South Bowenfels','2790','Bathurst','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-33.604630,150.120913),(4367,'South Littleton','2790','Bathurst','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-33.498267,150.135170),(4368,'Springvale','2790','Bathurst','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-33.412094,150.117190),(4369,'State Mine Gully','2790','Bathurst','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-33.456482,150.172201),(4370,'Vale Of Clwydd','2790','Bathurst','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-33.483955,150.176542),(4371,'Wolgan Valley','2790','Bathurst','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-33.259041,150.150781),(4372,'Wollangambe','2790','Bathurst','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-33.365624,150.428803),(4373,'Carcoar','2791','Orange','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-33.609622,149.140601),(4374,'Errowanbang','2791','Orange','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-33.545345,149.051172),(4375,'Burnt Yards','2792','Lachlan Valley','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-33.585625,149.031455),(4376,'Mandurama','2792','Lachlan Valley','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-33.648855,149.075273),(4377,'Darbys Falls','2793','Lachlan Valley','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-33.931096,148.859104),(4378,'Mount Mcdonald','2793','Lachlan Valley','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-33.916495,148.946017),(4379,'Roseberg','2793','Lachlan Valley','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-33.804739,149.024918),(4380,'Woodstock','2793','Lachlan Valley','Central West','NSW','Kelton, J.

At one time there were several sidings near the station with grain silos, stock yards, loading bank, goods shed, hay stage, and loco platform. In the 1980s services were suspended between Cowra and Blayney. The section was re-opened by the Lachlan Valley Railway which runs heritage trains from Cowra to Blayney. The railway station is now an art gallery and private residence.\r\nGold was discovered in 1868 at Woods Flat, a few kilometres south of Woodstock. A rush of 500 diggers took up the ground there, but after a short period only a few were left as surface gold was minimal and water supplies lacking. The goldfield had a long history but today almost nothing remains of the buildings at Woods Flat. The village of Woodstock was established in response to the building of the railway line north of Woods Flat, from Blayney to Cowra in 1880s. Initially known also as Woods Flat, the name of the village was changed to Woodstock in 1886.[3]\r\nBy 1900 there were many commercial businesses in the villages including butchers, bakers, hotels, saddleries, smithies, bootmakers, mercers, tailors, motor vehicle garages and billiard rooms. A post office was operating by 1897. The current Royal Hotel was rebuilt in 1911, an earlier timber building having been destroyed by fire. The Commercial Banking Company of Sydney opened a branch at Woodstock in 1907, followed by the Commonwealth Savings Bank in 1913 and the Bank of New South Wales in 1929. The Soldiers Memorial Hall was opened in 1925 by Sir Neville Reginald Howse, who was at that time the Member for Calare.[4]\r\nCountry markets are held at Woodstock Soldiers Memorial Hall on the second Sunday of each month except January. The Memorial Hall hosts a touring opera company, OperaWorks, each year. Other events at Woodstock include a long track motorbike championships and the annual show.\r\nThe bushranger John Vane, a member of Ben Hall\'s gang, who died in 1906 was buried in an unmarked grave at Woodstock cemetery. A headstone was erected by local historians in 1989.\r\nMedia related to Woodstock, New South Wales at Wikimedia Commons\r\nWoodstock is a village in the central west of New South Wales, Australia, 21 kilometres (13 mi) east of Cowra. It contains remains of a brief goldrush during the late 19th century which left behind a number of substantial buildings before the village relapsed into relative isolation. It includes a restored railway station, hotel and a memorial hall.

the district began in 1821. The first land grant in the general area known as Coombing Park was issued to Thomas Icely in 1829.\r\nIn 1989, Nestlé built a new pet food plant, Nestlé Purina, and purchased adjoining land including Blayney Foods. The Nestlé factory exports pet food to Asia and the Pacific.[7]\r\nThe town\'s railway station is served by the daily NSW TrainLink XPT service between Sydney and Dubbo and the weekly Outback Xplorer to Broken Hill, as well as several NSW TrainLink Coach and private company bus services connecting with Bathurst and Orange.\r\nIn 1994, Blayney became home to Australia\'s largest inland container terminal, which is situated beside the railway station.[8]\r\nThe Blayney Wind Farm, launched in 2000, is the largest of its type in Australia. It consists of 15 wind turbine generators on elevated ridges between Carcoar Dam and Mount Macquarie. Capacity is 10 megawatts, sufficient energy to supply 3,500 Australian homes.[9]\r\nA train line used to run from Blayney to the Lime Kilns, transporting lime. This is situated on land adjoining the Blayney Cemetery and is heritage listed. Remnants of the lime kilns can still be seen today.\r\nBlayney is a farming town and administrative centre with a population of 3,355 in 2011,[2] in the Central West region of New South Wales, Australia. Situated on the Mid-Western Highway about 240 km west of Sydney, 35 km west of Bathurst and 863 m above sea-level, Blayney is the seat of Blayney Shire Council.\r\nPrior to European settlement the area was probably occupied by the Wiradjuri or Gundungara Aborigines.\r\nMedia related to Blayney, New South Wales at Wikimedia Commons\r\nThe arrival of the railway in 1874 boosted development and Blayney replaced Carcoar as the major service centre to local farmlands. Blayney then became a municipality in 1882 and by 1900 a butter factory and freezing works employed many within the town. An abattoir opened in 1957 and this industry was later supplemented with tanneries and a pet food plant. The abbatoirs closed in 1999.[5]\r\nThe area that would become the town also boasted a mill, an inn and several houses by 1837, and then Governor Gipps proposed the creation of a village to be named Blayney in 1842. His proposed site, however, was about 9 km north-east of the present site in an area known as Kings Plains but once that spot proved unsuitable the Blayney village location was established on its present site in 1843.[3][4]\r\nThe Cadia-Ridgeway Mine is a major employer in the area.\r\nIn the late 1970s or early \'80s a meat canning factory was built on farmland land East of Blayney. This produced Spam and other canned meats. This was later turned into an export meat boning facility run by Ron Jones Exports and then a pet food factory. Prior to this, the dam on the land was famous for yabbies, with Sunday school excursions frequenting there.[6]',0,-33.532319,149.255263),(4494,'Browns Creek','2799','Bathurst','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-33.525683,149.149876),(4495,'Fitzgeralds Mount','2799','Bathurst','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-33.499865,149.377023),(4496,'Kings Plains','2799','Bathurst','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-33.500593,149.325200),(4497,'Neville','2799','Bathurst','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-33.709398,149.215073),(4498,'Vittoria','2799','Bathurst','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-33.435894,149.372967),(4499,'Belgravia','2800','Orange','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-33.123439,149.026661),(4500,'Bloomfield','2800','Orange','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-33.319696,149.088375),(4501,'Borenore','2800','Orange','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-33.247292,148.974505),(4502,'Cadia','2800','Orange','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-33.455109,148.993510),(4503,'Canobolas','2800','Orange','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-33.298346,149.047339),(4504,'Cargo','2800','Orange','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-33.423633,148.808929),(4505,'Clergate','2800','Orange','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-33.191476,149.110963),(4506,'Clifton Grove','2800','Orange','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-33.247034,149.173554),(4507,'Emu Swamp','2800','Orange','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-33.325740,149.200205),(4508,'Four Mile Creek','2800','Orange','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-33.428290,148.964642),(4509,'Huntley','2800','Orange','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-33.369243,149.131811),(4510,'Kaleentha','2800','Orange','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-32.618061,143.015537),(4511,'Kangaroobie','2800','Orange','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-33.173120,149.049508),(4512,'Kerrs Creek','2800','Orange','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-33.048539,149.092046),(4513,'Lewis Ponds','2800','Orange','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-33.271366,149.267788),(4514,'Lidster','2800','Orange','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-33.297893,148.958974),(4515,'Lucknow','2800','Orange','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-33.345662,149.161068),(4516,'March','2800','Orange','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-33.216351,149.076541),(4517,'Mullion Creek','2800','Orange','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-33.140704,149.120663),(4518,'Nangar','2800','Orange','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-33.462455,148.612370),(4519,'Nashdale','2800','Orange','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-33.296696,149.018299),(4520,'Ophir','2800','Orange','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-33.177045,149.239070),(4521,'Orange','2800','Orange','Central West','NSW','Owing to its inland location, the humidity is low in the summer months with the dewpoint typically around 10 °C.

Its claim as Australia\'s snowiest city is sometimes disputed by Ballarat in Victoria and nearby Lithgow.\r\nOrange has several music clubs which meet regularly. The Orange Blues Club[19] meets at the Victoria Hotel. The Orange Blues Club also hold an annual Blues Music Festival – Black Stump Blues Festival[20] The Orange Jazz Club[21] meets 1st Sunday monthly at the Royal Hotel.\r\nOrange is a sister city to:[25]\r\nOrange Regional Conservatorium\r\nOrange is a well-known fruit growing district, and produces apples, pears, and many stone fruits such as cherries, peaches, apricots, and plums; oranges are not grown in the area, since its climate is too cool. In recent years, a large number of vineyards have been planted in the area for rapidly expanding wine production. The growth of this wine industry, coupled with the further development of Orange as a gourmet food capital, has ensured Orange\'s status as a prominent tourism destination.\r\nThe Orange wine region is defined as the area above 600m in the local government areas of Orange, Cabonne and Blayney and can be usefully described as a circle around Orange. The Orange region is good for grapegrowing and winemaking due to a combination of geology, soils, climate and temperature. Together these factors combine to produce grapes and wine of distinct flavours and colour. The climate perhaps plays the biggest part in giving Orange some distinct natural advantages – the cool temperatures during most of the growing season coupled with dry autumn conditions are ideal for grape growing.[17]\r\nNewman\'s Bus Service operates route 2 on weekdays to Blayney.\r\nThe following Primary Schools are not within the city limits of Orange but are located within the rural fringe of Orange:\r\nOrange has a mild temperate climate with warm summers and cool winters, and with rainfall distributed fairly evenly throughout the year. Under the Köppen climate classification scheme, it has a moderate oceanic climate (Cfb). Compared with most population centres in Australia it has colder winters, especially in terms of its daytime maximum temperatures. In summer, the average (and absolute) maximum temperatures are also lower than in most inland centres, on account of its elevation.[11] The climate has enabled the area to be a major apple and pear producer, and more recently a centre for cool-weather wine production.[12]\r\nNSW TrainLink operate several coach services with connecting train services from Lithgow to Sydney, as well as a less frequent Coach service to Cootamundra for connection to Melbourne. Australia Wide Coaches operate a daily coach service to Sydney railway station.\r\nOrange is served by several radio stations, including 105.1 2GZFM, 105.9 Star FM, FM107.5 Orange Community Radio, 103.5 Rhema FM, HIT Country 88 FM and 2EL 1089AM – a commercial station that gets most of its programming from 2SM in Sydney. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) also broadcasts from four radio stations in Orange including ABC Local Radio (2CR) on 549AM and three national networks – ABC Classic FM on 102.7 FM, ABC Radio National on 104.3 FM, and Triple J on 101.9 FM.\r\nThe city receives five network television stations – Prime7 (a Seven Network affiliate), WIN TV (a Ten Network affiliate), Southern Cross Nine (a Nine Network affiliate), ABC TV and SBS One. All networks also provide additional digital-only television stations.\r\nOrange is situated on the Mitchell Highway, linking the city to Molong, Wellington, Dubbo and Bourke to the north west, and to Bathurst to the east and from there to Sydney via the Great Western Highway (260 km or 160 mi). Due west are Parkes (100 km or 62 mi) and Forbes (125 km or 78 mi), which is midway along the Newell Highway, running from Brisbane, Queensland to Melbourne, Victoria. In 2007 a bypass road, known as the northern distributor road, was opened for use after decades of planning.\r\nOther large industries include:\r\nThe following are listed as the suburbs within Orange City Council, according to the New South Wales Division of Local Government:[8]\r\nOrange is also serviced by a regional-class airport, Orange Airport, located approximately 15 km to the south of the city, in an area known as Huntley.\r\nCadia-Ridgeway Mine is a large open cut gold and copper mine located about 20 kilometres south of Orange, the mine has been developed throughout the 1990s employing several thousand employees with an expected lifespan of several decades.

The John Bull Hotel (later the Fat Lamb Hotel) was constructed, followed by a bridge over the creek. In 1881, the town was laid out and a police station, courthouse and school were built.[3]\r\nToday, the town includes a supermarket, two hotels, a newsagent, a butcher and golf and bowling clubs, as well as farm produce suppliers, a lucerne plant and a sawmill.[5] Eugowra is known for its granite, with more than 2000 slabs of local granite used in the new Parliament House in Canberra.[4]\r\nIt was near Eugowra where Australia\'s largest gold robbery took place. The infamous bushranger, Frank Gardiner and his gang, including Ben Hall ambushed the Forbes-Orange Cobb and Co coach on 15 June 1862.

Founded in 1982, the Gorillas have been a major force across the central competitions and currently compete in the Blowes Clothing Cup. The first grade side won their most recent premiership in 2009 defeating the Bathurst Bulldogs in the grand final, and also registered three straight minor premierships from 2009-2011. As well as seniors and women\'s teams, the Gorillas has a fantastic junior rugby program with U/13\'s, U/15\'s and U/17\'s teams, plus sub-juniors.\r\nIn late March 1926, Narromine experienced its biggest flood since 1893, with the Macquarie River peaking at 50 feet (15 m) at 5 am on 27 March.[14][15] Narromine was isolated due to floodwaters cutting roads, telephone lines and the railway line.[15] A large area of country around the town was covered in water. Very little damage was reported.[15] In the floods of April 1990, the river peaked at Narromine at a record 15.93 metres (52.3 ft).[16]\r\nMedia related to Narromine, New South Wales at Wikimedia Commons\r\nThe town of Narromine has produced several success stories, most recently sports personalities Glenn McGrath (Australian cricket team: Fast bowler ), Melinda Gainsford-Taylor (Sprinter: Commonwealth Games medalist), Disney animator Adam Phillips and Justin Smith (rugby league: North Queensland Cowboys). Other notable sportsmen to represent Australia at the International level include David Gillespie (Australian Rugby League) and David Jansen (International Gliding Championships).\r\nIn Rugby League, Narromine is represented by the Narromine Jets in the Group 11 Country Rugby League competition. Narromine has had a significant amount of success in this competition. Particularly, in 2002/2003 when their U18\'s took out the Group 11 competition with relative ease. The team defeated Dubbo Cyms in the 2002 grand final after completing the regular season undefeated. In 2003 the team lost only one game before defeating Dubbo Macquarie Raiders in a one sided affair.\r\nThe town name comes from a pastoral property, which in turn came from an Aboriginal word for \'honey person\'.[4][5]\r\nThe parish of Narromine is a cadastral parish in the county of Narromine. The parish extends from the eastern boundary of Narromine township going east till Minore. The township of Narromine is actually within the Parish of Wentworth, named after William Wentworth, prominent colonial politician, who owned land in Narromine Parish.\r\nNarromine is a town located about 40 kilometres (25 mi) west of Dubbo in the Orana region of New South Wales, Australia. It is the centre of Narromine Shire. At the 2011 census, Narromine had a population of 3,789.[1] The area is a popular area for gliding and the growing of citrus fruits. The Macquarie River passes through the town. The main road from Dubbo to the west also passes through, this being the Mitchell Highway named after the early explorer Sir Thomas Mitchell. The area is characterised by hot summers and mild winters.\r\nNarromine is heavily involved in regional sport. As a result of Narromine\'s proud sporting heroes this town has a great involvement in a number of different sports.\r\nThe Main West railway line extension between Dubbo to Nevertire, which included Narromine was officially opened on 20 October 1882.[7] The town was established after the railway opened, the first structures in the town being the railway platforms.[8] The township was gazetted in 1883, and the railway station opened on 1 May 1883.[2][9] It was renamed to its current spelling in October 1889.[9] Narramine Post Office opened on 20 October 1882 and was renamed Narromine in 1900.[10] The village of Narramine was proclaimed in 1885, and numerous buildings followed, including the police station built in 1890, the store (1890) and the Royal Hotel (1890).[2][11] A bridge over the Macquarie River was built in 1897.[2] After federation, the population of Narromine was 2,228 in the 1911 census, and in 1947 the population was 1,816.[12][13]',0,-32.231920,148.239606),(4581,'Bundemar','2823','Lachlan Valley','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-31.835994,148.180564),(4582,'Cathundral','2823','Lachlan Valley','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-31.921496,147.837012),(4583,'Dandaloo','2823','Lachlan Valley','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-32.269172,147.615413),(4584,'Gin Gin','2823','Lachlan Valley','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-31.938641,148.112824),(4585,'Trangie','2823','Lachlan Valley','Central West','NSW','Trangie is a town in the Orana region of New South Wales, Australia.

At the 2011 census, Nyngan had a population of 2,073 people.[1] Nyngan is situated on the Bogan River between Narromine and Bourke, on the junction of the Mitchell Highway and Barrier Highway, 583 km north-west of Sydney by road. The Barrier Highway starts at Nyngan, and runs west to Cobar and on through Wilcannia and Broken Hill into South Australia.\r\nAbout 70 kilometres south of the town a cairn has been erected in honour of Thurman the dog.[2]\r\nThe Municipality of Nyngan was proclaimed on 17 February 1891 with Nyngan having a population of 1355.\r\nIn April 1990, unusually heavy rains caused major flooding in the town, despite a massive effort by local people to raise the levee walls using sandbags. With the town almost completely flooded, all the residents had to be evacuated by helicopter from the railway station, the highest point of the town, which was not flooded. Air Force helicopters, TV news helicopters and private helicopters all co-operated in the airlift. The total damage amounted to $50 million. The airlift is commemorated by an Army helicopter placed outside of the Nyngan Railway Station. The railway station now houses a museum which includes exhibits relating to the 1990 flood. (The station had not been regularly used for train passengers since about 1980; the train line to Bourke has been out of use since 17 May 1989 but the Cobar line remains open to carry ore and wheat.[6][7])[8]\r\nThe district was originally inhabited by the Ngiyambaa Aborigines. Thomas Mitchell explored the Bogan River in 1835, camping on the future townsite. He recorded the local Aboriginal word nyingan, said to mean \'long pond of water\', though other meanings have been put forward, such as mussel or crayfish.[3] Squatters had settled in Mitchell\'s wake before he had begun his return journey.[4] The town flourished after completion of the railway line in 1883.\r\nRailway station (now museum), Nyngan\r\nHelicopter commemorating the airlift during the 1990 floods\r\nAbout 10 km west of the town is Australia\'s largest photovoltaic power station, with 1.36 million solar panels and will be the largest solar PV plant in the Southern Hemisphere when fully completed around June 2015.[9][10] It complements another plant at Broken Hill, which is expected to be fully operational by the end of 2015, for a combined capacity of 155 megawatts.[9]\r\nThe little town of Canonbar, 16 miles to the north-east on Duck Creek, needs to be mentioned. From the early 1840s until the middle \'eighties, it grew and flourished, servicing Canonbar Station and other properties, and Cobb and Co. travellers. In the early 1880s there were about four hotels, three or four banks, various stores, and tradesmen, a police station, a telegraph and money-order office, and representatives of churches. The Western Railway by-passed Canonbar, and where it crossed the Bogan was Nyngan. The Canonbar populace, goods and public institutions then all moved to Nyngan. By 1890 it was practically empty.[5]\r\nThe Bogan River at Nyngan\r\nNyngan Airport is a small airport just north of the town centre.

The sandstone rock once formed the bottom of a shallow inland sea where the remains of aquatic plants and animals were preserved. The site is especially important as a source of fossils of ancient mammals which, at that time, were small creatures living in a world dominated by dinosaurs. The fossils are sometimes opalised and discovered by opal miners. Important discoveries at Lightning Ridge include the ancestral monotremes Kollikodon ritchiei and Steropodon galmani.[9]\r\nThe town has a five star Olympic Pool, a diving complex, a rock climbing wall at the pool and Water Theme Park which operates during the summer months. Parts of the pool are protected by shade and the complex has barbecue facilities.\r\nSome artists have settled in and around Lightning Ridge. One of the most famous local Australian painters is John Murray who brings the impressions of the Outback, often in a situation with man or fauna onto the canvas.\r\nLightning Ridge hosted an annual goat race in the town\'s main street and a rodeo on the Easter long weekend until 2011. Goats were harnessed and driven by children, much like harness racing in equine sports. The goat races were accompanied by wheelie-bin races, and horse racing the following day.\r\nPaul Hogan was born in Lightning Ridge.\r\nThe traditional owners of the land around Lightning Ridge are the Yuwaalaraay people.[7] After they were displaced by the establishment of colonial pastoral stations, many Yuwaalaraay people stayed on as labourers, but were increasingly dispersed in the early 20th century. In 1936, several Indigenous families living at a local government settlement were forced to move to the Brewarrina settlement. Since that time, the local Indigenous population has increased because of the influx from other regions of Indigenous people seeking work in opal mining or agriculture.[8]\r\nMedia related to Lightning Ridge, New South Wales at Wikimedia Commons\r\nOpal mines and the plain that surrounds Lightning Ridge, NSW\r\nSince August 1992 when the Mining Act 1992 commenced, fossicking licences have not been required for fossicking in New South Wales.

The indigenous Ngiyampaa/Wangaapuwan traditions of this diverse bio-region are best represented in the rock art of Mount Grenfell, 40 km west of Cobar. Over 1,300 depictions of humans and animals, as well as hand stencils are found at this site.\r\nPastoralists began to settle the area in the mid-1860s.\r\nBattery\r\nAnnual mean wind speed at 9am and 3 pm is about 12.2 km/h with lesser speeds on winter mornings.[10][11]\r\nElevator\r\nRock with copper ore\r\nMiners Heritage Park, Cobar\r\nMonument to the miners who lost their lives\r\nOne of these pastoralists, a man known as \'Papa Cornish\', rescued a party of Aboriginal trackers from near-certain death in the early 1870s; in gratitude, they guided him to Australia\'s largest copper deposit. This led to settlements being founded with Australia\'s European and Asian gold rush immigrant arrivals. The Great Cobar Copper Mining Company Limited was established in 1878. It and subsequent companies operated a number of light railways[6] carrying ore and similar material, as well as timber for mine supports. Cobar and many mining outskirts accommodated the miners who travelled to the area in the late 1880s. The overwhelming majority of these were of Cornish Australian stock at the time.[7] Several fine heritage buildings from the late 1880s/early 1900s settlement are still in existence, including the Great Western Hotel (1898), reputed to have the longest iron lace verandah in the Southern Hemisphere, the Cobar Court House (1887) and Court House Hotel (1895) in Barton Street, as well as the interesting Cobar Heritage and Visitor Information Centre, located in the beautiful former Mines Office (1910). On Hillston Road southeast out of town is Fort Bourke Hill, which affords an excellent view of the town, as well as the historic Towser\'s Huts, a series of stone miners\' cottages dating back as early as the 1890s, possibly even the 1870s, and built by an Italian miner by the name of Antonio Tozzi.\r\nThe average relative humidity in Cobar during the summer is about 30% in the afternoon and about 50% at 9am. In winter it is about 45% at 3pm, and about 75% at 9am.\r\nAerial view 2009\r\nAt its peak, Cobar had a population on 10,000 and its own stock exchange. However, copper mining operations slowed in 1920, and by the 1930s the town\'s population had dropped to little over 1,000, only to rise again and stabilise at around 3,500 through the 1970s and early 1980s. Copper mining was intermittent until 1965 when full-time operations resumed.[8] In the 1980s, Gold, silver, lead and zinc were discovered in the area, which led to a further population increase. The town\'s current positive economic development is due to the affluence of the mining boom. Three important mining belts are operational in the Cobar area: the Cobar belt, the Canbelego belt and the Girilambone belt. Visits to mine sites may be arranged through the Cobar Heritage and Visitor Information Centre overlooking the open cut mine. The Festival of the Miners\' Ghost, held during the last weekend in October, is a festival celebrating the spirits of the old miners.\r\nCobar has a semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification BSh) with hot summers and cool winters. It has a median annual rainfall of 390mm. Rainfall is extremely variable, particularly in late summer and early spring. The highest rain falls have been in excess of 200mm in any one month. Rainfall is generally only about 4 days per month.\r\nMedia related to Cobar, New South Wales at Wikimedia Commons\r\nThe Cobar economy relies heavily on trade with the local mines and their employees, and consequently on world metal prices and hence is subject to great fluctuations. During 2008, after a fall of 75% in world zinc prices, one local mine cut 540 of its 655 jobs, with flow-on effects felt by many other businesses. Over the course of that year Cobar\'s workforce reduced by 10%.[9] The town has increasing benefit from being the seat of the local government area. Cobar has two primary schools, a high school, an activities youth centre and a 31-bed hospital for acute care.\r\nCobar is a town in central western New South Wales, Australia. The town is 712 km (442 mi) northwest of the state capital, Sydney. It is at the crossroads of the Kidman Way (to Queensland) and Barrier Highway (to South Australia).

This was the third largest inland port in the country during the great river boat era of the mid-19th century.[3] At the 2011 census, Wilcannia had a population of 604.[1]\r\nThe Bourke-Wilcannia road, near Bourke\r\nWilcannia Police Station with Melia azedarach\r\nIn 1835, explorer Major Thomas Mitchell was the first European to the region, in which he traced the Darling River to what is now Menindee.[4] In June 1866, the township of Wilcannia was proclaimed.[4] In 1871, the population was 264, and grew to 1,424 by 1881.[5] During the 1880s, Wilcannia reached its peak, and had a population of 3000 and 13 hotels and its own newspaper,[4] the Western Grazier. It was, with Wentworth, Echuca, Mannum and Goolwa, one of the major Murray-Darling river ports which played a vital part in the transport of goods, notably wool and wheat, in the days of the paddle-steamers.\r\nStreet Scene\r\nStreet Scene\r\nWilcannia has a semi-arid climate with hot summers and mild to cool winters. Mean maximum daily temperature in summer is 34 °C and in winter is 19 °C. The highest temperature recorded in Wilcannia was 50.0 °C (122.0 °F) on 11 January 1939.[6] This was during the severe heatwave of January 1939.\r\nThe name Wilcannia is said to be derived from an Aboriginal term for either \'gap in the bank where floodwaters escape\' or \'wild dog\'. Neither meaning has been linguistically verified.[3]\r\nfrom the bed of the Darling River\r\nOn 9 November 1950, a severe thunderstorm with damaging winds and large hail the size of cricket balls struck the town. Two people were injured, dozens of homes lost their roofs and nearly every house in town was damaged due to the large hail.[8]\r\nAbandoned Building\r\nAbandoned building by the Darling River\r\nBridges over the Darling River\r\nOld warehouse\r\nMedia related to Wilcannia, New South Wales at Wikimedia Commons\r\nFrom the 2011 Census, Wilcannia had a population of 604 with 466 (77%) people being of Aboriginal descent. Wilcannia has 211 private dwellings.[1] The suburb was listed as one of the most socially disadvantaged areas in the State according to the 2015 Dropping Off The Edge report.[9]\r\nThe surrounding area is very sparsely settled by pastoralists who have large land holdings, used primarily to run sheep. These holdings fall in the Western Division and the majority are held as 99-year leases.\r\nWilcannia is located where the Barrier Highway crosses the Darling River, 965 kilometres (600 mi) from Sydney. The environment is borderline semi-arid to desert with an annual rainfall of 255 millimetres (10.0 in).

The line was extended from Capertee to Rylstone (7 km to the north of Kandos) on 9 January 1884.[10] Kandos station was opened in 1915 as Candos before being renamed Kandos the same year.[4]\r\nCement haulage ceased following closure of the cement works in 2012, while coal haulage ceased following closure of Charbon colliery in 2015.\r\nOn 25 May 2007, the rail owner Rail Infrastructure Corporation announced that the Kandos to Gulgong line would be suspended from use.[11]\r\nKandos is a small town in New South Wales, Australia, in the Mid-Western Regional Council. It is located on the Bylong Valley Way. At the 2011 census, Kandos had a population of 1,284 people.[1]\r\nThe town was originally named Candos, an acronym of the Board of NSW Cement, Lime and Coal Co Ltd.[3] In 1915, the name Candos was considered too similar to Chandos in South Australia, and the name was changed to Kandos, the name was registered with the NSW Registrar General.[4]\r\nThe town was established in 1913 to take advantage of local supplies of limestone. The New South Wales Cement Lime and Coal Company lifted the limestone from quarries by an enormous aerial ropeway.[2]\r\nThe line has been reopened temporarily for charter passenger tours, as recently as November 2015.[12][13]\r\nAnother major industry in the region was coal-mining. Centennial Coal operated the Charbon coal mine until its closure. The underground mine closed in March 2014,[7] while open cut mining continued until 2015.[8]\r\nPassenger rail to Mudgee closed in 1985.[14]\r\nSince 1985, coach services from Kandos south to Lithgow and north to Mudgee have provided the only passenger connection to Kandos. The operator was Countrylink until 30 June 2013, which was rebranded as NSW Trainlink from 1 July 2013.\r\nKandos also has the Harley Museum of NSW containing a collection of early model bikes.\r\nThe town contains the northern-most Field Support Centre of Endeavour Energy.[9]\r\nFor many years Kandos\' main non-agricultural industry was the production of cement. However, the cement manufacturing facility and associated limestone quarry (both operated by Cement Australia) were closed in September 2011.[5] This was expected to result in the loss of 98 jobs.[6]',0,-32.857495,149.969460),(4766,'Bogee','2849','Lithgow - Mudgee','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-32.975826,150.104239),(4767,'Breakfast Creek','2849','Lithgow - Mudgee','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-32.676966,150.012848),(4768,'Budden','2849','Lithgow - Mudgee','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-32.502023,150.081841),(4769,'Bylong','2849','Lithgow - Mudgee','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-32.417309,150.114058),(4770,'Camboon','2849','Lithgow - Mudgee','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-32.708450,149.959934),(4771,'Carwell','2849','Lithgow - Mudgee','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-32.840409,149.906368),(4772,'Coggan','2849','Lithgow - Mudgee','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-32.349639,150.090370),(4773,'Coxs Creek','2849','Lithgow - Mudgee','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-32.735933,150.138500),(4774,'Coxs Crown','2849','Lithgow - Mudgee','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-32.750604,150.046932),(4775,'Dabee','2849','Lithgow - Mudgee','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-32.824533,150.038690),(4776,'Dungeree','2849','Lithgow - Mudgee','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-32.751226,149.867728),(4777,'Dunville Loop','2849','Lithgow - Mudgee','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-32.904580,150.136232),(4778,'Ginghi','2849','Lithgow - Mudgee','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-32.584119,150.088533),(4779,'Glen Alice','2849','Lithgow - Mudgee','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-33.043925,150.216201),(4780,'Growee','2849','Lithgow - Mudgee','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-32.620543,150.068963),(4781,'Kelgoola','2849','Lithgow - Mudgee','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-32.871618,150.280871),(4782,'Lee Creek','2849','Lithgow - Mudgee','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-32.535051,150.119193),(4783,'Mount Marsden','2849','Lithgow - Mudgee','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-32.938690,150.047574),(4784,'Murrumbo','2849','Lithgow - Mudgee','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-32.403330,150.230338),(4785,'Nullo Mountain','2849','Lithgow - Mudgee','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-32.729269,150.234097),(4786,'Olinda','2849','Lithgow - Mudgee','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-32.796019,150.167675),(4787,'Pinnacle Swamp','2849','Lithgow - Mudgee','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-32.771363,149.925929),(4788,'Pyangle','2849','Lithgow - Mudgee','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-32.620816,149.932721),(4789,'Reedy Creek','2849','Lithgow - Mudgee','Central West','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-32.729382,149.993111),(4790,'Rylstone','2849','Lithgow - Mudgee','Central West','NSW','Nearby towns and villages\r\nEarly buildings were constructed of timber slabs and stringy bark, later wattle and daub became common. Plentiful sandstone in the area led to significant buildings being constructed of that material.[2]\r\nEnergy supply to Rylstone is provided by Integral Energy,[44] prior to this Turon County Council, and earlier Rylstone Shire Council provided the electricity infrastructure.[34]\r\nA petition was sent to Governor Gipps asking for a village to be called Tong Bong to be established at the present site of Rylstone. Governor Gipps granted permission for the village to be surveyed but he insisted that the village be called Rylstone and not Tong Bong. There is no evidence of any connection between Governor Gipps and the English village of Rylstone.[2]\r\nA not for profit community radio station serves the Rylstone and Kandos area, KRR-FM broadcasts from Mount Coombermellon on frequency 98.7 MHz.[45] Real-FM/2MG from Mudgee is the licensed commercial area broadcaster, Real-FM rebroadcasts its signal into Rylstone and Kandos on 97.9 MHz.[46]\r\nBy 1868 there were four Hotels, the Rylstone Hotel, Bridge View, Shamrock and the Globe.[2] The Rylstone and Globe Hotels remain in business. The Shamrock Hotel was located on the southern side of the railway bridge and was built by Michael Hayes in 1885 closing in 1890.[2]\r\nEarly maps spell Rylstone as Rylestone.\r\nVehicle\r\nThe main commercial street, Louee Street, was originally an upper level and lower level street. In the 1930s the street was levelled and this created the high steps to the buildings on the high side of the road.[2]\r\nRylstone is a small town in New South Wales, Australia, in the Central Tablelands region within the Mid-Western Regional Council local government area. It is located on the Bylong Valley Way road route. At the 2006 census, Rylstone had a population of 615 people.[1]\r\nRylstone is predominantly an agricultural community with wool, sheep, cattle, wine grapes, and olives, being among the main pursuits. Coal mining and cement production are also significant employers in the community with these works being located in the nearby town of Kandos.\r\nRylstone is a popular venue for ultralight aviation, gyrocopters, and paragliding enthusiasts. The Rylstone Airstrip is used for this activity.[50] The Airstrip was sold by the Mid Western Regional Council to a private individual who intends to keep the strip for aviation purposes.[51]\r\nSeveral early explorers and settler explorers travelled this area in the early 1800s; they include Samuel Marsden, Macquarie, Edward Cox, James Blackman Jr.,[3] Jamison, FitzGerald, John Nevell and James Vincent.[2] Several mountains in the area commemorate their journeys through the Glen Alice Valley and up the Turon River.[2] James Blackman jnr. explored a route from Bathurst to the Cudgegong River and present site of Rylstone in 1820.[4] Allan Cunningham, the botanist and explorer, on his first expedition to find a route from Bathurst to the Liverpool Plains noted in his diary in November 1822 being in the Tabrabucka area and on the second expedition 18 April 1823 passing through Dabee (now Rylstone).[5]\r\nAir\r\nThe Rylstone District was governed by a separate local government area known as the Rylstone Shire Council which was formed on 5 December 1906.[2] Prior to that the area was administered by the Department of Public Works.[2] In 2004 the New South Wales Government conducted an inquiry that found evidence of deteriorating finances as well as breaches of regulations in appointments and management of staff. It ruled all civic offices to be vacated and appointed an Administrator to manage Councils affairs.[41] The Council\'s relatively small area was ultimately amalgamated with the Mudgee Shire Council in March 2006 to become the Mid Western Regional Council.\r\nRylstone has retained its original character buildings from its beginnings, a few buildings of note are the Bridge View Inn, the Globe Hotel, the post office, the police station, the courthouse and the shire hall. The old town granary was built in the early 1840s.\r\nRelated Wikipedia sites\r\nIn April 1895 a railway telephone line was installed between Wallerawang and Mudgee with Rylstone as an intermediate telephone point. The telephone was an important safety feature on this railway due to the steep cliffs and tunnels that occur on both sides of Rylstone allowing quick and clear communication of problems.[10]\r\nThe name \'Rylstone\' has no clear origin; however, several possible origins are promoted.[2]\r\nThe district was originally known as Dabee (under various spellings). There are many contemporary newspaper references to the town being referred to as Ryalston in the period 1846 to mid-1850s[6] then referred to as Ryalstone during the late 1850s.[7] Rylstone town was laid out in 1846 by surveyor Davidson.

It had a population of 299 at the 2011 census, including 21 indigenous people (6%) and 20 foreign born people (6%).[1]\r\nIn 2012, the tiny township was selected as the Most Outstanding Community in New South Wales and the ACT (with a population of 15,000 or less) in a competition organised by the Bank of New South Wales. The town sealed its local airstrip, installed kangaroo-proof fences around the perimeter, and put in night lighting, with half of the costs coming from private donations. Locals had been upset that the Royal Flying Doctor Service had not been able to land there for a medical emergency involving one of the leading members of the local population. The town also successfully searched the world to recruit its own doctor, when the Health Department had said that no suitable doctor could be found. And five locals came forward to form a team of local volunteer ambulance officers, in support of the one full-time paramedic that is provided by the NSW Ambulance Service. Finally, the town constructed a spacious sports centre in a dollar for dollar agreement with the local Shire. All of these projects in the one year contributed to Tottenham\'s selection as Community of the Year for NSW.[citation needed]\r\nOne possible definition of the centre for New South Wales is located

Australia. At the 2011 Census, the village had a population of 332 people. It is surrounded by open country and has a rural appearance. It has a village character though it is practically a suburb on the edge of Canberra. The village itself features historic buildings that existed before the establishment of Canberra.\r\nIn the Hall area the rocks are all Silurian age volcanic rocks. Green grey and purple quartz andesite and dacite from the Hawkins Volcanics are under the village and extending up the Halls Creek valley. Green-grey dacite and quartz andesite from the Hawkins Volcanics cover the surrounding areas including up to the New South Wales border, north to One Tree Hill, south east to the Harcourt Hill and south to the north edge of Belconnen. Dark grey to green grey dacitic tuff is found over the other side of the New South Wales border, and also within the Australian Capital Territory near Gooromon Ponds Creek.[4]\r\nIn 1980 the highway alignment was shifted to the west as part of a dual carriage upgrade, bypassing Hall completely.\r\nIn 1911 the Australian Capital Territory was gazetted and Hall was within the boundary of the land allocated, near the New South Wales border. It was also one of the sites considered for a capital city in the Yass district. Hall did not grow as it suffered with few amenities and it was not provided with town water until 1967.[2] In 1954 the main street of Hall (which had been part of the state highway system since 1935) was named the Barton Highway.\r\nSome features of note within Hall village are:[2]\r\nGeorge Palmer established his Palmerville Estate in 1826 in Ginninginderry with a homestead located on the banks of Ginninderra Creek adjacent to the presentday suburb of Giralang. The estate encompassed much of what is now Belconnen and southern Gungahlin. It adjoined the Charnwood Estate to the west and Yarralumla Estate to the east. The combined area of the Ginninderra and Charnwood Estates was nearly 20,150 acres (8155 ha).\r\nThe new village called Ginninderra was officially proclaimed in 1882, but after protests from local residents was renamed Hall, in honour the first landholder in the area, Henry Hall. The village was planned on a rectangular grid. The first sale of land occurred in 1886.\r\nBy 1861 a store, post office, cottages and homestead had been set up on a property owned by William Davis, about 3 km south of Hall at Ginninderra. This settlement was known by residents as Ginninderra village. In 1881 the NSW Government surveyed the area for an official village and chose a site on Halls Creek.

The Community Celebration of Christmas is run by Committee of volunteers assisted by the local Service Clubs- Lions and Rotary. The focus of the event is the Community and children and each year the lights are turned on by a special guest/guests of honour chosen for their contribution to the Community. The Borough of Queenscliffe has a high percentage of volunteers and it is usually volunteers that are chosen as the special guest/guests of honour in recognition of their contribution to the community. Santa arrives at 7:25pm in the local Fire Brigade Truck, whilst throwing lollies to the children, to start an evening of entertainment by local performers. Glowcandles are sold as a fundraiser for maintaining equipment on the tree with all profits supporting the ongoing lighting of the tree. The tree itself is decorated by community volunteers and service club members coordinated by The Christmas Tree Committee. Festooning is hauled up by hand and manually secured into the tree. This tree can be found at the corner of Grimes Road and Point Lonsdale Rd, Point Lonsdale, Victoria. When lit up this tree can be seen for miles out to sea and is a Queenscliffe Borough icon, having been lit since about 1952–1953. When the lights are on you know Christmas is getting close.\r\nThe Post Office opened on 15 January 1902.[2]\r\nThe traditional owners of this area are the Wautharong people of the Kulin nation. The escaped convict William Buckley, the first known European to have lived in the area, lived with local Aborigines from 1803 to 1835. A signal station was built in 1854. Permanent European settlement began at Point Lonsdale in the latter half of the 19th century with the construction of a lighthouse in 1863 and the extension of the railway line from Geelong to Queenscliff in 1879. Since settlement, many ships have been wrecked on the rocky reefs at the entrance to Port Phillip.\r\nGolfers play at the course of the Lonsdale Golf Club on Fellows Road.[9] Bowlers bowl at the Point Lonsdale Bowling Club.[10] Surfers surf with the Point Lonsdale Boardriders Club [11]\r\nAlong the open coast there are regular sightings of threatened marine mammals such as Humpback and Southern Right Whales.[8]\r\nThe town is named after police officer William Lonsdale[3] and is the birthplace of former Premier of Victoria Thomas Hollway.\r\nNext to the town is Lake Victoria a shallow saline lake that is part of the Lonsdale Lakes Nature Reserve and an important site for the waterbirds and migratory waders that form part of the population using the Ramsar-listed Swan Bay wetland system.[7]\r\nPoint Lonsdale is a coastal township on the Bellarine Peninsula, near Queenscliff, Victoria, Australia. The town is divided between the Borough of Queenscliffe and the City of Greater Geelong. Point Lonsdale is also one of the headlands which, with Point Nepean, frame The Rip, the entrance to Port Phillip. The headland is dominated by the Point Lonsdale Lighthouse. At the 2011 census, Point Lonsdale had a population of 2,466.[1]\r\nThe coastal rock platforms and adjacent waters are included in the Port Phillip Heads Marine National Park. The intertidal platforms have the highest invertebrate diversity of any calcarenite reef in Victoria, while subtidal areas are characterised by diverse and abundant algal communities as well as by encrusting organisms such as ascidians, sponges and bryozoans.[8]\r\nPoint Lonsdale contains several Victorian Heritage Register listed sites, including:\r\nThe township of Point Lonsdale has also been used in some episodes of the hit children\'s series Round the Twist for some of the exterior scenes.[citation needed]\r\nAn aerial view of Point Lonsdale',0,-38.286113,144.614489),(5543,'Queenscliff','3225','Surf Coast - Bellarine Peninsula','Geelong','VIC','Not yet populated',0,-38.267113,144.661329),(5544,'Swan Bay','3225','Surf Coast - Bellarine Peninsula','Geelong','VIC','Not yet populated',0,-38.252385,144.616144),(5545,'Swan Island','3225','Surf Coast - Bellarine Peninsula','Geelong','VIC','Not yet populated',0,-38.249982,144.688434),(5546,'Ocean Grove','3226','Surf Coast - Bellarine Peninsula','Geelong','VIC','Not yet populated',0,-38.270293,144.540778),(5547,'Barwon Heads','3227','Surf Coast - Bellarine Peninsula','Geelong','VIC','Not yet populated',0,-38.281078,144.491790),(5548,'Breamlea','3227','Surf Coast - Bellarine Peninsula','Geelong','VIC','Not yet populated',0,-38.293801,144.395262),(5549,'Connewarre','3227','Surf Coast - Bellarine Peninsula','Geelong','VIC','Not yet populated',0,-38.250963,144.387919),(5550,'Bellbrae','3228','Surf Coast - Bellarine Peninsula','Geelong','VIC','Not yet populated',0,-38.329558,144.262559),(5551,'Bells Beach','3228','Surf Coast - Bellarine Peninsula','Geelong','VIC','Not yet populated',0,-38.367595,144.281720),(5552,'Jan Juc','3228','Surf Coast - Bellarine Peninsula','Geelong','VIC','Not yet populated',0,-38.344147,144.303646),(5553,'Torquay','3228','Surf Coast - Bellarine Peninsula','Geelong','VIC','Not yet populated',0,-38.332818,144.323890),(5554,'Anglesea','3230','Surf Coast - Bellarine Peninsula','Geelong','VIC','Not yet populated',0,-38.405129,144.189268),(5555,'Aireys Inlet','3231','Surf Coast - Bellarine Peninsula','Geelong','VIC','\r\nAt low tide it is possible to walk (or scramble) around all these rocks and beaches, making it possible to walk along the beach, all the way from Eastern View - the historical start of the Great Ocean Road, all the way to Anglesea.\r\nAireys Inlet has a number of heritage listed sites, including:\r\nIn 2005 the Bollywood movie Salaam Namaste was produced in Melbourne with many scenes being shot around Aireys Inlet, Fairhaven and Anglesea.\r\nIn the early 19th century, before European settlement, the escaped convict William Buckley lived here in a primitive hut eating fish, shellfish, wild raspberries and sugar ants. Aireys Inlet was known to the Aboriginals of the time as Managwhawz. The town takes its current name from John Moore Cole Airey, who settled in the area in 1842.[2]\r\nThe Post Office opened on 1 April 1893.[3]\r\nMedia related to Aireys Inlet, Victoria at Wikimedia Commons\r\nThere is also a horseshoe-shaped reef at Step Beach which forms an excellent swimming hole at low tide. The towns main attraction, the Split Point Lighthouse overlooks the inlet. The lighthouse has made Aireys Inlet an icon along the Great Ocean Road.\r\nDuring the early 1950s the Australian crime author Arthur Upfield lived at Aireys Inlet. His novel The New Shoe (1951) is based on the township and the lighthouse. Some of the novel\'s characters drew on local identities.\r\nAireys Inlet is a small coastal inlet and town located on the Great Ocean Road, southwest of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Aireys Inlet is located between Anglesea and Lorne, and joined with Fairhaven to the west. At the 2006 census, Aireys Inlet had a population of 1,148.[1]\r\nPainkalac Creek, which separates Aireys Inlet from Fairhaven, forms a salt lake or inlet behind the sand dunes before it cuts through to the ocean. Due to low water levels in the inlet it is not often that the inlet breaks through.\r\nWhile the coastline at adjacent Fairhaven is a long uninterrupted sand beach, the coast at Aireys Inlet is a series of rock shelves, interrupted by sandy swimming beaches, most of which are relatively secluded. Each beach has its own character, a result of differing lengths, orientation and nearby rock formations. Beaches include Sandy Gully, Steppy Beach and Sunnymeade.\r\nMany surfers holiday in Aireys Inlet to take advantage of the popular Fairhaven beach. As the inclination of the beach can change dramatically between years, the surf is regarded as unpredictable. Swimmers should take note there is a strong rip current.\r\nMany scenes from the children\'s television series Round the Twist were filmed at or around the area of the Split Point Lighthouse.\r\nAireys Inlet was devastated by the infamous 1983 Ash Wednesday bushfires in which a large number of houses were burnt down. However, after a brief lull, interest in the area resumed and has been steadily climbing since.

The bay was named by a Captain Loutit in 1845 when he sheltered his vessel, the Apollo, here from a storm.\r\nIn winter to spring, southern right whales come to the area mainly to breed, to give birth their calves, and to raise them in the warmer, calm waters of South Australia during their migration season. Less frequently, humpback whales can be seen off the coast.\r\nMedia related to Apollo Bay, Victoria at Wikimedia Commons\r\nApollo Bay was part of the traditional lands of the Gadubanud or King Parrot people of the Cape Otway coast.[2]\r\nThe first European settlers were timber cutters in the 1850s who subsequently established sawmills.[3] Farmers later moved into the area and a small settlement on Apollo Bay named Middleton developed. A Post Office of that name (with a fortnightly mail delivery) opened on 1 May 1873 (relocated to the township of Krambruk in 1881 and renamed Apollo Bay in 1898).[4] During this period almost all access to the area was by sea.\r\nOn July 10, 1932 the coastal steamer Casino sank while attempting to berth at the town jetty. Ten lives were lost. Earlier shipwrecks have occurred along the Cape Otway coastline.\r\nIn 1936 a submarine telegraph and telephone cable from Apollo Bay to Stanley provided the first connection to Tasmania from the mainland. The Apollo Bay Telegraph station closed in 1963 and is now a museum.\r\nWith the upgrade of the road to the town in 1927 and the completion of the Great Ocean Road in 1932, the town became a tourist destination and an important fishing port.\r\nEvents and festivals held in Apollo Bay include:\r\nApollo Bay is a coastal town in southwestern Victoria, Australia. It is situated on the eastern side of Cape Otway, along the edge of the Barham River and on the Great Ocean Road, in the Colac Otway Shire.

It is common on calm days for there to be as many as 20 abalone dive boats operating along the shoreline beneath the light house. Commercial cray fishers use baited pots or traps throughout the reef system, with white floats on the surface marking their locations.\r\nEight ships were wrecked along the coast of Cape Otway.[4] These included the Marie (1851), Sacramento (1853), Schomberg (1855), Loch Ard (1878), Joseph H. Scammell (May 1891), Fiji (September 1891) and the Casino in 1932. The first American vessel sunk during World War II, the SS City of Rayville, was also sunk off the Cape by a German mine. Following this, the Americans built a radar bunker on the cape in 1942; it is now open to the public.\r\nA telegraph office opened in 1859. The post office opened on 1 September 1880 and closed in 1972.[3]\r\nCape Otway was originally inhabited by the Gadubanud people; evidence of their campsites is contained in the middens throughout the region.

Noorat is located approximately 218 km west of Melbourne. The township is located at the base of Mount Noorat, a dormant volcano, which is considered to have Australia\'s largest dry crater. At the 2006 census, Noorat had a population of 252. By 2011, according to the census, the population had dropped to 167,[1] although this drop in numbers is a bit deceptive as the town boundary was changed in between the 2006 and 2011 census.\r\nThe township has two schools, Noorat Primary School, and the Noorat campus of Mercy Regional College, which has recently been renovated and now houses the year 7 and 8 students of the school. There is also the senior campus at Camperdown. The Glenormiston campus of South West Institute of TAFE is located a few kilometres north-east of the township, on the other side of the mountain.\r\nThe Post Office opened on 1 August 1874 as Mount Noorat, and was renamed Noorat in 1875.[2]\r\nNoorat has a local football team, the Kolora-Noorat Power, who merged in 2002 from the Noorat Bombers and Kolora Magpies. They compete in the Warrnambool & District Football League. Their colours are teal, black and white.\r\nFrederick Taylor, MacKillop and Smith\'s manager at Strathdownie was responsible for one of the worst massacres in the western district of Victoria somewhere along Mount Emu Creek (once known as Taylor\'s River) near Noorat in August 1839. This was verified by Niel Black, who found a mass grave on the Glenormiston property.\r\nNoted author, Alan Marshall, was born in Noorat\'s general store, in 1902.\r\nMedia related to Noorat at Wikimedia Commons\r\nNoorat derives its name from Mount Noorat, a dormant volcano named by explorer Major Thomas Mitchell after a local Indigenous elder, Ngoora. Europeans first settled the Noorat area in early 1839 when MacKillop and Smith established a run called Strathdownie – which was renamed Glenormiston by Niel Black, a Scotsman from Cowall in Argyll who purchased the property in 1840.\r\nPrior to European settlement, the area near Mount Noorat was a traditional meeting site where Indigenous tribes – the Kirrae Wuurong people - held ceremonies, bartered goods and settled disputes. There are conflicting reports about the number of Indigenous people living in the district at the time of white settlement, but in 1841, the population of the Mount Noorat clan numbered only four people. An outbreak of smallpox during the 1830s was one cause of the population decline and the alleged massacre of Indigenous people by white settlers was another.\r\nThere is currently one place of public worship in Noorat, the Neil Black Memorial Presbyterian Church.\r\nThe settlement history of Noorat is closely linked with the Black family and the establishment of Glenormiston. Noorat ostensibly grew as a service centre for the Black family estate and many of the early residents either emigrated with Niel Black or worked at Glenormiston.',0,-38.191027,142.929541),(5671,'Noorat East','3265','Colac - Corangamite','Warrnambool and South West','VIC','Not yet populated',0,-38.207970,142.973112),(5672,'Panmure','3265','Colac - Corangamite','Warrnambool and South West','VIC','Not yet populated',0,-38.337534,142.725221),(5673,'Taroon','3265','Colac - Corangamite','Warrnambool and South West','VIC','Not yet populated',0,-38.342070,142.872698),(5674,'The Sisters','3265','Colac - Corangamite','Warrnambool and South West','VIC','Not yet populated',0,-38.198076,142.769514),(5675,'Bullaharre','3266','Colac - Corangamite','Warrnambool and South West','VIC','Not yet populated',0,-38.343488,143.141647),(5676,'Cobden','3266','Colac - Corangamite','Warrnambool and South West','VIC','Not yet populated',0,-38.328583,143.077199),(5677,'Cobrico','3266','Colac - Corangamite','Warrnambool and South West','VIC','Not yet populated',0,-38.291280,143.017563),(5678,'Elingamite','3266','Colac - Corangamite','Warrnambool and South West','VIC','Not yet populated',0,-38.366951,143.021100),(5679,'Elingamite North','3266','Colac - Corangamite','Warrnambool and South West','VIC','Not yet populated',0,-38.346708,143.014801),(5680,'Glenfyne','3266','Colac - Corangamite','Warrnambool and South West','VIC','Not yet populated',0,-38.401647,142.987414),(5681,'Jancourt','3266','Colac - Corangamite','Warrnambool and South West','VIC','Not yet populated',0,-38.368137,143.097811),(5682,'Jancourt East','3266','Colac - Corangamite','Warrnambool and South West','VIC','Not yet populated',0,-38.388460,143.146555),(5683,'Naroghid','3266','Colac - Corangamite','Warrnambool and South West','VIC','Not yet populated',0,-38.260257,143.056853),(5684,'Simpson','3266','Colac - Corangamite','Warrnambool and South West','VIC','Not yet populated',0,-38.496167,143.210488),(5685,'Scotts Creek','3267','Colac - Corangamite','Warrnambool and South West','VIC','Not yet populated',0,-38.448909,143.106230),(5686,'Ayrford','3268','Colac - Corangamite','Warrnambool and South West','VIC','Not yet populated',0,-38.415663,142.859450),(5687,'Brucknell','3268','Colac - Corangamite','Warrnambool and South West','VIC','Not yet populated',0,-38.466719,142.917465),(5688,'Cooriemungle','3268','Colac - Corangamite','Warrnambool and South West','VIC','Not yet populated',0,-38.541094,143.078426),(5689,'Cowleys Creek','3268','Colac - Corangamite','Warrnambool and South West','VIC','Not yet populated',0,-38.483271,143.054403),(5690,'Curdies River','3268','Colac - Corangamite','Warrnambool and South West','VIC','Not yet populated',0,-38.457871,142.956959),(5691,'Adelaide University','5005','Adelaide City','Adelaide - Central and Hills','SA','Not yet populated',0,-34.919398,138.603510),(5692,'Heytesbury Lower','3268','Colac - Corangamite','Warrnambool and South West','VIC','Not yet populated',0,-38.564595,142.921624),(5693,'Newfield','3268','Colac - Corangamite','Warrnambool and South West','VIC','Not yet populated',0,-38.559974,143.010759),(5694,'Nirranda','3268','Colac - Corangamite','Warrnambool and South West','VIC','Not yet populated',0,-38.500415,142.760581),(5695,'Nirranda East','3268','Colac - Corangamite','Warrnambool and South West','VIC','Not yet populated',0,-38.479060,142.847696),(5696,'Nirranda South','3268','Colac - Corangamite','Warrnambool and South West','VIC','Not yet populated',0,-38.530660,142.793949),(5697,'Nullawarre','3268','Colac - Corangamite','Warrnambool and South West','VIC','Not yet populated',0,-38.469347,142.749913),(5698,'Paaratte','3268','Colac - Corangamite','Warrnambool and South West','VIC','Not yet populated',0,-38.541490,142.974983),(5699,'The Cove','3268','Colac - Corangamite','Warrnambool and South West','VIC','Not yet populated',0,-38.486643,142.709140),(5700,'Timboon','3268','Colac - Corangamite','Warrnambool and South West','VIC','Timboon Fine Ice-Cream is popular around tourist areas in the south west, such as Port Campbell and Peterborough.

This is part of the Portland Wind Project\r\nThe area was settled in the 1860s by the Henty family who had settled nearby Portland, and a post office opened in 1863 (closed 1968) though known as Bridgewater Lower for some years.[2]\r\nCape Bridgewater is home to a colony of up to 650 fur seals and has the highest coastal cliff in Victoria. These cliffs are suitable spot to observe southern right whales in winter and spring. The cape itself also boasts a large blowhole and karst solution pipes, colloquially known as the petrified forest,[7] but now known to be hollow tubes of limestone, eroded as a result of millions of years of rainfall. Bridgewater Bay and the adjacent Cape form a partially submerged volcanic caldera. To the west is a large area with huge sand dunes. For these reasons the Cape and the nearby coastal area is classed by the government as the second most important coastline in Victoria, after the \'Twelve Apostles\', along the Great Ocean Road\r\nCape Bridgewater is a locality in the Australian state of Victoria located on the western shore of Bridgewater Bay about 21 kilometres (13 mi) south-west of Portland and about 383 kilometres (238 mi) west of Melbourne.\r\nBoth Cape Bridgewater and Bridgewater Bay were named by named after the Duke of Bridgewater (1756-1829), by Lieutenant James Grant sailing on the Lady Nelson on 4 December 1800.[3][4][5][6]\r\nCape Bridgewater includes the following protected areas within its boundaries -

Bacchus Marsh was created a district on 14 October 1862, and the Road Board was the governing body until the Shire of Bacchus Marsh was proclaimed on 23 January 1871.[11] The railway came to Bacchus Marsh on 15 February 1887, and the through line to Ballarat was built in 1890.[8][11][12]\'\r\nA bus service connects the station with the town centre and other residential areas.\r\nCommunity Learning\r\nBacchus Marsh and its suburbs form the largest settlement in Moorabool Shire.\r\nAutomobiles are the main form of transport.

The freeway divides Bacchus Marsh and its northern suburb Darley. Two interchanges serve the urban area - the Gisborne Road full diamond and Bacchus Marsh Road half diamond. With the exception of the central business district and neighbouring areas, the majority of the urban area is laid out in a street hierarchy pattern with collector roads leading to the two major cross roads - Bacchus Marsh Road (C602) and Bacchus Marsh-Gisborne Road/Bacchus Marsh-Geelong Road (C704) which bearing the majority of vehicular traffic.\r\nBacchus Marsh Airfield (located in Parwan to the south) provides for general aviation and the area is home to a flying school and three gliding clubs.\r\nIn 1994 the Shire of Bacchus Marsh was amalgamated with the Shire of Ballan and parts of the Shires of Bungaree and Werribee to form the Shire of Moorabool.[13]\r\nTraditionally a market garden area, producing a large amount of the region\'s fruits and vegetables in recent decades it has transformed into the main commuter town on the Melbourne-Ballarat corridor with its affordable starter homes proving popular.[3][4]\r\nBacchus Marsh contains a number of heritage listed sites, including:\r\nIt was named after one of its original inhabitants, Captain William Henry Bacchus, who saw the great value of this locality as it was situated on two rivers — the Lerderderg and Werribee.\r\nOne of the first white men to reach the Bacchus Marsh valley was pastoralist Kenneth Scobie Clarke (c. 1806–79), a native of Sutherland in Scotland. Clarke was a manager for the Great Lake Company of Van Diemen’s Land and arrived in the Port Phillip District from George Town on 25 March 1836. Captain Bacchus credited Clarke as being the first man to shear sheep in Victoria, although the Hentys had arrived in Portland with their sheep some two years earlier.\r\nWalks along the Lerderderg River provide access to the steep, rugged and overgrown Lerderderg Gorge and the extensive Wombat State Park that surrounds it, criss-crossed by four-wheel drive tracks, extensive bushwalking amongst historic mining relics and natural bush.\r\nIn 1838, Englishman Captain William Henry Bacchus (1782–1849, originally of the 2nd Royal Surrey Militia) and his son William Henry Bacchus junior (1820–87) also brought sheep from Tasmania and came to the district which now bears their name. On their arrival, Clarke made an arrangement with them and ceded his run, moving to the nearby hills known as the Pentlands. The then very swampy valley was not really suitable for sheep, as they were prone to footrot. Clarke stayed in the district until 1840 or 1841, and later went to New Zealand, where he died in 1879.\r\nBeyond central Bacchus Marsh, suburban areas such as the former towns of Darley (1861) to the north and Maddingley to the south continue to grow rapidly.

Local government was established in the area with the creation of the Borough of Tarnagulla in 1864. The borough was surveyed in 1864. By 1865, the town had reached its peak with a wide range of businesses operating including 4 hotels, 9 general stores, 3 surgeons, a share broker and watchmaker. In September of that year, the Tarnagulla court held its first sitting. Residents of the town included around 1,000 Chinese as well as groups of Greeks and Italians.[3]\r\nTarnagulla is fonetic meaning of Polish Czarnogóra[5] (eng. Black Mountain - Montenegro). Name was given by Polish explorer and geologist Paweł Strzelecki.\r\nFrom 1854, the focus of the miners turned to quartz mining with the discovery of the Poverty Reef. The reef was named by one of its discoverers, Mr. Hatt, in remembrance of Poverty Bay, New Zealand where he had been saved from drowning by a Māori woman. The Poverty lode was unusual in that the gold was found in large blocks of quartz.[3] Allegedly the richest pocket of reef gold ever found, more than 13.5 tonnes (430,000 ozt) of gold was recovered from Poverty Reef in 13 months from an area 3 metres wide and 120 metres deep (10 ft by 400 ft).[2]\r\nGolfers play at the course of the Tarnagulla and District Golf Club on Gladstone Street.[9]\r\nMedia related to Tarnagulla at Wikimedia Commons\r\nTarnagulla is a gold mining town in central Victoria, Australia. The town is in the Shire of Loddon local government area, 183 kilometres (114 mi) north west of the state capital, Melbourne. At the 2011 census, Tarnagulla had a population of 304.[1]\r\nEuropean settlement in the area began with the taking up of Tarnagulla station in the 1840s.[2] Gold was first found in the area in 1852 by prospectors on their way to the Korong goldfields near Wedderburn. The discovery led to a gold rush as more than 5,000 miners made their way to the diggings.[3] The settlement created by these miners was first at known as Sandy Creek and was renamed Tarnagulla, after the station in 1860.[2] Reflecting this, the Post Office opened on 13 August 1856 as Sandy Creek and was renamed Tarnagulla on 2 January 1861.[4]\r\nLater settlement focused on agriculture with sheep raising and wheat growing established in the area. A sawmill was established at nearby Bulla-bul Creek in 1863, and the railway from Dunolly reached Tarnagulla in 1888.[6] New technology such as the use of cyanide allowed rework of some of the tailings of earlier mines. In 1906 the famous Poseidon nugget, weighing 26.6 kilograms (860 ozt) was found at Tarnagulla.[2] The nugget was named after the racehorse Poseidon, winner of the 1906 Melbourne Cup.\r\nToday the major industries in Tarnagulla include agriculture, fruit growing and flax oil production.[2]\r\nThe first miners in the area were prospectors from South Australia followed by many more from other diggings and from around the world. A canvas town grew up quickly to service the needs of the miners. In 1853, the first gold nuggets were found near Tarnagulla at Nuggetty Gully with one pair of miners finding 86 lb (39 kg)[dubious – discuss] of gold in a fourteen-day period. Many other large nuggets including one weighing 32 lb (14.5 kg)[dubious – discuss] were found in the area.[3]\r\nThe development of agriculture continued with the establishment of a flour mill in 1873. The mill was operational until 1917 and in 1920 the mill was relocated to Mildura.[7] Gas streetlighting was established in Tarnagulla in 1869 and operated until the arrival of electricity in the town in 1950.[8]',0,-36.774013,143.833431),(6788,'Toolleen','3551','Maryborough - Pyrenees','Ballarat','VIC','The town is now mainly an agricultural region, with wine grape growing becoming more popular.[2]\r\nDuring the Victorian Gold Rush and after the discovery of gold at nearby Rushworth, Toolleen was a busy intersection where the roads linking Bendigo and Beechworth and Melbourne and the Murray River port of Echuca crossed.[2]\r\nToolleen Post Office opened on 12 July 1872.[3]\r\nMedia related to Toolleen, Victoria at Wikimedia Commons\r\nToolleen is a town in northern Victoria, Australia.

Air transport is provided by Kerang Airport.\r\nThe town is also on the Swan Hill railway line, served by V/Line trains from Kerang station to Melbourne, as well as coach services to Balranald. The Kerang-Koondrook Tramway once linked the town to Koondrook from 1889, being closed to passengers in 1976,[5] and closed 1981.[6] On 5 June 2007, a semi-trailer collided with a passenger train at a level crossing, 6 kilometres (3.7 mi) north of the town, killing 11 people.[7] This was the worst train disaster in Victoria since 1969.[8]\r\nThe Burke and Wills expedition passed through Kerang on their journey to cross Australia from Melbourne to the Gulf of Carpentaria. On Sunday, 2 September 1860 the expedition camped at Booth & Holloway\'s Tragowel Station to the south of Kerang. On Tuesday, 4 September 1860 they passed through Kerang, crossed the Loddon and camped at Mr. Fenton\'s Reedy Creek Run, making Camp XIII, (their thirteenth camp since leaving Melbourne).[3]\r\nKerang\'s symbol is a flying ibis. The area around Kerang is dotted with lagoons and lakes (including Lake Tutchewop) and is believed to have the most populous ibis rookeries in the world with an estimated 200,000 ibis using the area for breeding each year, along with many other waterbirds. It is also a popular recreational destination. Many of the wetlands have been recognised by inclusion in the North Victorian Wetlands Important Bird Area and as being of international significance through listing under the Ramsar Convention.[4]\r\nThe town has an Australian Rules football team competing in the Central Murray Football League.[9]\r\nKerang was declared a shire in 1871; at the time the settlement\'s population was 109. The arrival of the railway from Bendigo in 1884 and the construction of a tramway to Koondrook in 1888 led to expansion; by 1891 the population had increased to over a thousand. The spread of Patchell\'s irrigation ideas improved local productivity and the town continued to expand.\r\nKerang has a horse racing club, the Kerang Turf Club, which schedules two race meetings a year including the Kerang Cup meeting in March.[10]\r\nGolfers play at the course of the Kerang Golf Club on Koondrook Road.[11]\r\nKerang is a rural town on the Loddon River in northern Victoria in Australia. It is the commercial centre to an irrigation district based on livestock, horticulture, lucerne and grain. It is located 279 kilometres (173 mi) north-west of Melbourne on the Murray Valley Highway a few kilometres north of its intersection with the Loddon Valley Highway, elevation 78 metres (256 ft). At the 2011 census, Kerang had a population of 3,872.[1] Kerang is believed to be an Aboriginal word for Cockatoo.\r\nKerang also has a thriving skatepark community, with freestyle BMX and skateboarding enthusiasts regularly honing their skills at the park.\r\nMedia related to Kerang, Victoria at Wikimedia Commons\r\nThe Wemba-Wemba Aborigines are thought to have been the area\'s first occupants. Thomas Mitchell was the first European to visit the area, in 1836. Squatters began to settle in the area in 1845 and in 1848 Richard Beyes opened a public house at a river crossing near the future townsite. This was followed by a saddlery and a church. In 1857 Woodford Patchell built a bridge upriver from the settlement which drew traffic from the earlier settlement. He built a store, house and hotel that became the center of what was to become Kerang. Patchell was the first farmer in the state to use irrigation and experimented with oats, barley, maize, millet, tobacco, beet, cotton and sugarcane. The Post Office opened on 29 July 1858. An earlier Kerang office, quite distant, was renamed Wedderburn on the same day.[2]',0,-35.735049,143.918869),(6904,'Kerang East','3579','Upper Murray exc.

The Barmah National Park is on the floodplain of the Murray River, and when it floods is an important breeding ground for Murray cod. The flood is enhanced by the geological features of the riverbed, as the channel narrows at an area known as the Barmah choke.\r\nThe border between the two states is the mostly westward-flowing Murray River. Just downstream of Barmah, the Murray winds south, then east far enough to put a small point of New South Wales directly south of Barmah before resuming its generally westwards course.\r\nA Barmah Post Office opened on 16 September 1876 and was renamed Barmah East in 1907, closing in 1951. Barmah Township Post Office opened on 2 May 1902.[4]\r\nThe geography at Barmah is explained by a geological event that occurred 25,000 years ago, when an uplift of land along the Cadell fault forced the Murray River onto a new course for 500 km. The river had to force its way through the Barmah choke taking over the Goulburn River in the process.[5] The uplifted land that led to these changes is noticeable as a continuous, low, earthen embankment along the road leading into Barmah from the west, which may appear to the untrained eye as man-made.\r\nMedia related to Barmah, Victoria at Wikimedia Commons\r\nBarmah is a town in Victoria, with the distinction of being located north of the border with New South Wales. At the 2011 census, Barmah had a population of 181.[1]\r\nThe Barmah area was first settled in 1856 by Joseph Waldo Rice who established the Murray Fishing Company to supply fish for the gold mining region of Bendigo, Victoria.[2] Barmah was, for a time beginning in the early 1880s, a prosperous centre, whose chief industry was sawmilling. There were two major sawmills; that of Robert Barbour on the N.S.W. side of the river, and James MacIntosh\'s and E. Whitely\'s on the Victorian side. Much of the timber was exported to India for piles and railway sleepers until a government prohibition of the export of redgum, which forced closure of the Barmah mills. Trade picked up later, with the expansion of the railway network and a new sawmill was opened by R. Evans, who shipped the sawn timber to Echuca on his steamboat, the Edwards.[3]\r\nThe Barmah Forest is listed under the Ramsar Convention for wetlands and, with various state forests in New South Wales, has been identified as an Important Bird Area.

The area has 300 days of sunshine a year. The average wettest day Cobram would have is around 30 millimetres.\r\nV/Line once serviced Cobram with regular daily passenger trains as part of the Shepparton service. These train services were discontinued in 1993.[36] Now V/Line operates multiple daily return connecting coach services between Cobram and Melbourne,[37] as well as multiple return services to Albury and Mildura.[38]\r\nBy the 1860s, present day Cobram still hadn’t begun to exist, and the area was still broadly referred to as Yarroweyah.[7] In 1868, the old township of Cobram, bound by Warkil Street to the west and the Murray River to the east was reserved for future use, about 15 kilometres west of Cobram East.[8]\r\nAboriginals, although they had disappeared from the area prior to European settlement, were believed to inhabit the stretch of region bound by the Murray River from Tocumwal to the east of Cobram and south as far as the Broken Creek. Unfortunately, the area bound by Melbourne, Echuca and Albury was a trouble area for recording Aboriginal presence. The main tribe believed to have occupied the area were the Bangerang. A ‘horde’, or smaller grouping of about 100 persons, named Angootheraban, are believed to have lived in the immediate Cobram area.[3]\r\nCobram township was finally proclaimed by Sir John Fuller, Governor of Victoria, on 2 December 1912. Two years later, electricity for the town was being produced by a local coal-fired power plant.[15]\r\nCobram is a town in Victoria, Australia. It is on the Murray River which forms the border between Victoria and New South Wales. Cobram along with the nearby towns of Numurkah and Yarrawonga is part of Shire of Moira and is the administrative centre of the Council. Its twin town of Barooga is located on the north side of the Murray River. Surrounding Cobram are a number of orchards, dairy farms and wineries. At the 2011 census, Cobram had a population of 6,018.[1] Barooga\'s population is currently 1,497.[2]\r\nA Peaches & Cream Festival is held biennially around the second or third weekend in January. It is Australia’s oldest running festival, with a town parade and music festival located at Thompson’s Beach.[28]\r\nCharles Sturt first passed through the region on the northern bank of the Murray River in June 1838 en route to South Australia, leading a cattle droving party, with 300 head of cattle.[4]\r\nMurray Heights is the name given to the estate of relatively recent residential area that runs along the sand hills of River Road on the town’s eastern edge. The sandy mounds had previously been occupied by orchards.\r\nCobram has an Australian Rules football team in the Murray Football League called the Cobram Tigers.[34] Cobram has one soccer team named Cobram Roar which participate in the Albury wodonga football association fa. Cobram also has two cricket teams which play in the Murray Valley Cricket Association, one being Cobram Yarroweyah United which is based at Scott Oval in Cobram .\r\nSt. Joseph’s Catholic primary school was opened in 1922[16] and in 1925, the Cobram Golf Club opened a 9-hole course near the Murray Valley Highway, transferring three years later to the current location in Barooga.[17]\r\nSmaller towns located nearby include Strathmerton, home of a large Bega cheese processing plant, Yarroweyah, Katamatite, Katunga, Koonoomoo and the larger towns of Yarrawonga on the Victorian side and Tocumwal on the New South Wales side.\r\nThe town split from Tungamah Shire and Cobram Shire was formed on 1 April 1953, after increasing agitation from the townspeople with the operations of the Tungamah Shire.[20] The first Shire President was Mr Norm Jordan, a long-standing Cobram business man. Almost ten years later, in 1962, the first high school opened in the town.[21] In May 1972, the first connections to town sewerage were made, totaling 1000 by 1976.[22]\r\nThrough the 1980s and 1990s, Cobram was awarded many town awards, including Tidiest Town in Victoria in 1991 and 1993.[23] In 1993, Cobram Shire was amalgamated with Yarrawonga, Numurkah, Nathalia and Tungamah Shires to form the Moira Shire.[24]\r\nCobram adopted yet another town plan in 1949, the first rural Victorian town to do so, with high anticipation of population growth and the proliferation of industry.[18] In 1950, the first of such expansions was realised, with the creation of the Murray Valley Co-operative Dairy Producers and Trading Company, the predecessor of Murray Goulburn Co-operative.[19]\r\nAlthough there are no named suburbs in the town, there are areas which can be discriminated by locals due to their colloquial names.\r\nUp until this time, the area of Cobram was part of the Echuca Shire, Cobram station was inc',0,-35.916758,145.650715),(7072,'Cobram East','3644','Upper Murray exc.

It was not until 1824, when Hamilton Hume and William Hovell passed through the area on their expedition from New South Wales to Geelong in Victoria, that the land was assessed and opened for settlement. Squatters soon moved in and vast stations for wheat production and livestock grazing were quickly established. During the 1860s the Victorian Land Acts allowed for the subdivision of large holdings and a provision for Selectors to take up small allotments at minimal cost. This saw an increase in the population of the area and the need to establish more local facilities. Four schools had been established in the area prior to 1920 along with a hotel, sawmill and dairy.\r\nThe now disused Dookie to Katamatite railway, classed as a tramway for the first two years of its life, opened in 1882 carrying light freight, grain and passengers. A weighbridge and grain silo, which still exist, were built next to the rail line.

The club officially went into recess at the end of the 1967 season.\r\nEuropean settlement began in the Tintaldra in 1837 with the arrival of squatters looking for fresh grass and water for cattle. The town began to form around 1854 as unlucky prospectors began to look for land to farm, though of insufficient size to justify a Post Office until 1 January 1867.[2]\r\nTintaldra\'s economy is based around agriculture and tourism. The Tintaldra store, constructed in 1864 with rough hewn River Red Gum beams and rafters and walls made from vertical slats of Stringybark timber, is still standing today.

It is however, only 5 minutes from either road.\r\nUntil the 1980s much of the area along the Ovens River was planted with tobacco. Other production in the area included beef and dairy cattle, orchards and market gardens. In recent years, wine grape growing has been introduced to the area[3] so that the area, being at the apex of the Ovens Valley and King Valley, is the centre of a significant food region with many farm gate and cellar door sales.\r\nThe town is in the valley of the Ovens River and in the Rural City of Wangaratta local government area, 274 kilometres (170 mi) northeast of the state capital, Melbourne and 32.3 kilometres (20.1 mi) southeast of the regional centre of Wangaratta. At the 2011 census, Whorouly and the surrounding area had a population of 519.[1] Prior to the 1994 Kennet Government council amalgamations (and the creation of the Rural City of Wangaratta), the township was in the (now disbanded) Shire of Oxley.\r\nTown facilities currently include churches, children\'s playground, sporting ground & public hall, a combined primary school & pre-school,[4] a combined hotel/pub/general store,[5] a local well renowned cafe called The 2 Cooks Cafe [6] and several self-catering holiday rentals and B&B\'s. There is also a garage with fuel facilities. The garage was known as Whorouly Motors but recently changed its name to Alpine Performance [7] changing focus to support the growing performance car and motorbike market in the region.\r\nThe town was surveyed and proclaimed in 1868, adopting the name of a nearby station. Whorouly Primary School opened in 1874.[2] The first European settlers established large grazing properties but after the Victorian gold rush, closer settlement took place.

At its peak, Beechworth town had over 3,100 residents.[4] Surrounding areas and mining camps sprang up as thousands of miners rushed into areas such as Spring Creek, Reedy Creek, Silver Creek, the Nine Mile Creek and the Woolshed increasing the population on the Ovens to around 22,000.[5] The Chinese were not allowed to live in Beechworth town and resided on the outskirts. Numerous controls and enforced regulations and licence checks existed against the Chinese miners.(see: Woods; also McWaters; also O\'Brien; and Cronin). Beechworth Cemetery has a large preserved section of early Chinese miners/pioneers. The presence of the Chinese goldminers around Beechworth and throughout Victoria\'s north-eastern region created social unrest and these are recorded in O\'Brien\'s; Woods\'; and Cronin\'s works below.\r\nDuring its boom times, Beechworth town boasted a range of industries including, a tannery, jewellers, boot makers, a brewery, blacksmiths, livestock sale yards. It had schools, a convent, hotels, a prison with imposing stone walls, a hospital, a mental hospital, court house, police barracks, stage coach companies and a powder magazine.\r\nLike many Australian country towns associated with the early goldfields, Beechworth had its share of colourful characters and villains. Among the infamous during the 1870s was the one-time Livery Stable owner, later the \'Dog Officer\', at some other time the \'Pound Officer\' and another time shire revenue officer, John Phelan.[6] Phelan was a continual litigant, correspondent to the newspapers and advertiser. His official and officious escapades were mockingly reported in the local paper.[7]\r\nBeechworth is a well-preserved historical town located in the north-east of Victoria, Australia, famous for its major growth during the gold rush days of the mid-1850s. At the 2011 census, Beechworth had a population of 2,789.\r\nRobert O\'Hara Burke, leader of the ill-fated Burke and Wills expedition was stationed in Beechworth as Senior Inspector of Police from 1854 to 1857.[8] Policeman John Sadleir, one of the Kelly Gang pursuers, was also stationed in Beechworth during its early days.(Harvey)\r\nGeorge B. Kerferd (1836–1889) a longtime resident of Beechworth became a Premier of Victoria and was a major participant in ensuring Beechworth had a railway connection to Melbourne.\r\nBorn in 1886, died in 1962. Judge.[12]\r\nOriginally used for grazing by the settler David Reid, the area was known as Mayday Hills until 1853, when it was renamed Beechworth. The Post Office opened on 1 May 1853 as Spring Creek and was renamed Beechworth on 1 January 1854.[2]\r\nIn its golden heyday from 1852–1857, this was a fabulous gold region and centre of government; but its power, wealth and influence were short lived. At its wildest moments of gold discoveries, Woods related how an early party of prospectors retrieved a pan of gold weighing 14 pounds (6.4 kg) 14 lb (about 7 kg).(p. 10.) Another lucky party, said Woods, cleared some 50 pounds (23 kg)50 lb (approx. 25 kg) of gold in a week.(p. 16.) And so began a rush into this remote region. During the first election campaign in 1855, one candidate, Daniel Cameron, rode a horse shod with solid gold horseshoes. The extravagance of this event is still commemorated as the logo for Beechworth is a golden horseshoe.\r\nBeechworth\'s many historical buildings are well preserved and the town has re-invented itself and evolved into a popular tourist destination and growing wine-producing centre.\r\nThe Ovens and Murray Advertiser still survives as a local paper.\r\nAt the time, Beechworth was far removed from the centre of colonial administration in Melbourne both in distance and time taken to travel. The local debates around the potential railway into Beechworth encompassed a broad gauge (5 ft 3 in/​1,600 mm) option or a narrow gauge (2 ft 6 in/​762 mm) system, between Wangaratta and Beechworth and these debates and options appeared in the Ovens and Murray Advertiser newspaper. Ironically, in the 1890s a narrow gauge system did eventuate nearby, running from Wangaratta to Whitfield. Finally,a railway, the broad gauge, arrived at Beechworth in September 1876,[3] but by that stage the town and its gold production was waning. Unfortunately the rail line was closed in 1977 and dismantled, after 101 years of service.\r\nBorn in 1897 died in 1983. Sportsman, businessman and sports administrator.[11]\r\nBeechworth is a popular tourist destination. Attractions include Ned Kelly themed displays at the old court house and Ned Kelly Weekend, which is Australia’s most significant recreation of the Kelly legend it commemorates the anniversary of the outlaw’s committal hearing held in the historic Beechworth Courthouse from 6 to 11 August 1880.

The town appears to have taken its name from a group of squatters from Maffra, a village in the Monaro region of NSW,[citation needed] with its location between current Maffra and Newry being written on an early map. The squatters moved on, but the name remained. The Monaro Maffra was probably connected to Mafra, a town in Portugal.[citation needed]\r\nMaffra is considered to have one of the prettiest main streets (Johnson St) in Victoria[by whom?]. The Wellington Shire Council removed the 100+ year old trees that line it because of disease, but has since replaced them with young oaks.\r\nGolfers play at the course of the Maffra Golf Club on Fulton Road.[6]\r\nThe township was settled in the 1860s, the Post Office opening on 20 July 1864.[3]\r\nMaffra is a town in Victoria, Australia, 220 kilometres (140 mi) east of Melbourne. It is in the Shire of Wellington local government area. It relies mainly on dairy farming and other agriculture,[2] and is the site of one of Murray-Goulburn Cooperative\'s eight processing plants in Victoria. Maffra is a detour off the Princes Highway and is near Sale, Stratford, Newry, Tinamba, Heyfield and Rosedale.[2] At the 2011 census, Maffra had a population of 5,112.[1]\r\nThe Gippsland Vehicle Collection Motor Museum[4] is for lovers of old cars. It is housed in a huge old sugar beet building which the Car Club has cleaned and given new life.\r\nMaffra hosts a Mardi Gras every March, the Maffra and District Agricultural, Pastoral and Horticultural Show in October and a tennis tournament at Easter.\r\nThe town has an Australian Rules football team competing in the Gippsland Football League.[5]\r\nIt was long the beef cattle capital of West Gippsland and, for many years, the only beet sugar processing centre in the country.[citation needed] The Beet Museum, set in the Port of Maffra Park, has relics from the defunct sugar beet industry. The building is a relocated historic weighbridge building, and is lined with pine boards from the home of Charles and Grace Quirk, one of Maffra\'s first cottages.[2]\r\nIn recent years Maffra has become a hub for backpackers seeking to complete Regional work requirements to achieve a second year visa. With growing salad and vegetable farming industries in the surrounding area it is considered a great town for working travelers. Maffra Lodge provides accommodation all year round to cater for backpackers.\r\nMaffra has two primary schools, the Maffra Primary School and St Mary\'s Primary School (Catholic). Maffra also has a public secondary school, Maffra Secondary College, which has a student enrolment of around 700. Maffra Secondary has a strong academic program and is involved in a number of community service programs.\r\nA local group is working at Bellbird Corner, restoring the area to the popular picnic area it was in the 1900s.[2]\r\nMedia related to Maffra, Victoria at Wikimedia Commons',0,-37.966701,146.975445),(7725,'Nuntin','3860','Wellington','Latrobe - Gippsland','VIC','Not yet populated',0,-38.224369,146.430136),(7726,'Riverslea','3860','Wellington','Latrobe - Gippsland','VIC','Not yet populated',0,-38.011789,146.935746),(7727,'Valencia Creek','3860','Wellington','Latrobe - Gippsland','VIC','Not yet populated',0,-37.834649,146.982729),(7728,'Castleburn','3862','Wodonga - Alpine','Hume','VIC','Not yet populated',0,-37.573541,147.187425),(7729,'Cobbannah','3862','Wodonga - Alpine','Hume','VIC','Not yet populated',0,-37.627220,147.207559),(7730,'Crooked River','3862','Wodonga - Alpine','Hume','VIC','Not yet populated',0,-37.387647,147.106614),(7731,'Dargo','3862','Wodonga - Alpine','Hume','VIC','Not yet populated',0,-37.279921,147.302010),(7732,'Hawkhurst','3862','Wodonga - Alpine','Hume','VIC','Not yet populated',0,-37.423056,147.120095),(7733,'Llowalong','3862','Wodonga - Alpine','Hume','VIC','Not yet populated',0,-37.918808,147.075738),(7734,'Meerlieu','3862','Wodonga - Alpine','Hume','VIC','Not yet populated',0,-38.002228,147.391595),(7735,'Munro','3862','Wodonga - Alpine','Hume','VIC','Not yet populated',0,-37.925194,147.185405),(7736,'Perry Bridge','3862','Wodonga - Alpine','Hume','VIC','Not yet populated',0,-38.001149,147.225366),(7737,'Stockdale','3862','Wodonga - Alpine','Hume','VIC','Not yet populated',0,-37.782622,147.203663),(7738,'Stratford','3862','Wodonga - Alpine','Hume','VIC','Not yet populated',0,-37.966108,147.080128),(7739,'Waterford','3862','Wodonga - Alpine','Hume','VIC','Not yet populated',0,-37.515637,147.204588),(7740,'Fernbank','3864','Gippsland - East','Latrobe - Gippsland','VIC','Not yet populated',0,-37.860878,147.341513),(7741,'Glenaladale','3864','Gippsland - East','Latrobe - Gippsland','VIC','Not yet populated',0,-37.731090,147.313351),(7742,'The Fingerboard','3864','Gippsland - East','Latrobe - Gippsland','VIC','Not yet populated',0,-38.326496,142.115859),(7743,'Lindenow','3865','Gippsland - East','Latrobe - Gippsland','VIC','Not yet populated',0,-37.800359,147.458491),(7744,'Jumbuk','3869','Latrobe Valley','Latrobe - Gippsland','VIC','Not yet populated',0,-38.398143,146.424652),(7745,'Yinnar','3869','Latrobe Valley','Latrobe - Gippsland','VIC','Not yet populated',0,-38.322120,146.327779),(7746,'Yinnar South','3869','Latrobe Valley','Latrobe - Gippsland','VIC','Not yet populated',0,-38.388731,146.376374),(7747,'Boolarra','3870','Gippsland - South West','Latrobe - Gippsland','VIC','Not yet populated',0,-38.378924,146.275377),(7748,'Boolarra South','3870','Gippsland - South West','Latrobe - Gippsland','VIC','Not yet populated',0,-38.445642,146.263091),(7749,'Budgeree','3870','Gippsland - South West','Latrobe - Gippsland','VIC','Not yet populated',0,-38.422532,146.363744),(7750,'Grand Ridge','3870','Gippsland - South West','Latrobe - Gippsland','VIC','Not yet populated',0,-38.492506,146.440941),(7751,'Mirboo East','3870','Gippsland - South West','Latrobe - Gippsland','VIC','Not yet populated',0,-38.445603,146.199917),(7752,'Allambee Reserve','3871','Baw Baw','Latrobe - Gippsland','VIC','Not yet populated',0,-38.285262,146.054894),(7753,'Allambee South','3871','Baw Baw','Latrobe - Gippsland','VIC','Not yet populated',0,-38.343735,146.099585),(7754,'Baromi','3871','Baw Baw','Latrobe - Gippsland','VIC','Not yet populated',0,-38.403622,146.176387),(7755,'Darlimurla','3871','Baw Baw','Latrobe - Gippsland','VIC','Not yet populated',0,-38.370717,146.210740),(7756,'Delburn','3871','Baw Baw','Latrobe - Gippsland','VIC','Not yet populated',0,-38.332631,146.228385),(7757,'Mirboo','3871','Baw Baw','Latrobe - Gippsland','VIC','Not yet populated',0,-38.472256,146.207687),(7758,'Mirboo North','3871','Baw Baw','Latrobe - Gippsland','VIC','Not yet populated',0,-38.401141,146.161440),(7759,'Gormandale','3873','Wellington','Latrobe - Gippsland','VIC','Coordinates: 38°17′S 146°42′E﻿ / ﻿38.283°S 146.700°E﻿ / -38.283; 146.700\r\nGormandale is a small town in eastern Victoria, Australia.

Delegate in NSW is the next major town geographically across the NSW/Vic Border from Orbost.\r\nThe town also boasts a field hockey club which fields junior, women\'s and men\'s sides in the East Gippsland Hockey Association.\r\nOrbost straddles the Princes Highway. The town was connected to Melbourne via the Orbost railway line in 1916, and operated until 1987, principally carrying timber and farming produce. In the early days of the railway\'s operation dedicated passenger trains ran but these ceased by the 1930s. The track infrastructure was dismantled in 1994. The line traversed a mixture of farmland, hills and heavily forested country. It included numerous bridges, including the Stoney Creek Trestle Bridge, the largest of its kind in Victoria.[6] Public transport services are provided to the town by V/Line, a coach bus service between Canberra and Bairnsdale, that operates three times per week.[7]\r\nOrbost has a regional airport, Orbost Airport YORB (RBS).\r\nThe national parks are showcased in events such as The Wilderness Bike Ride, a community event managed out of Orbost, which won the Best Event 2004 Regional Tourism Award for East Gippsland.\r\nThe Cameron family settled on the rich alluvial river flats in 1876, followed by many other selectors, many of them Scottish migrants. The Post Office opened on 1 December 1880 named Neumerella (sic) and was renamed Orbost in 1883. A Newmerella office opened in 1889 and closed in 1897, then reopened in 1921.[2] The township was proclaimed in 1890 and a bridge constructed across the Snowy River and a telegraph office established. Sawmills were established in the area and the first batch of sawn timber was cut at Orbost in 1882. By the late 1890s produce was regularly being exported to Melbourne via coastal trading vessels sailing up the Snowy River to Orbost. The railway from Melbourne arrived in 1916, allowing further agricultural settlement up the valley, and exploitation of native hardwood forests for timber and railway sleepers.\r\nThe Snowy Mountains Scheme resulted in the waters of the Snowy River being diverted to the Murray and Murrumbidgee Rivers and associated irrigation schemes. During the 1990s the low level of water in the Snowy River was a major concern, with a political campaign to increase the flow of water from the dam at Jindabyne. Independent candidate from the Orbost district, Craig Ingram, was elected in 1999, and re-elected in 2002, to the Victorian Legislative Assembly on a platform to increase the flow of water in the Snowy River.[citation needed]\r\nOrbost is a town in the Shire of East Gippsland, Victoria, Australia, 375 kilometres (233 mi) east of Melbourne and 235 kilometres (146 mi) south of Canberra where the Princes Highway crosses the Snowy River. It is about 16 kilometres (10 mi) from the town of Marlo on the coast of Bass Strait. At the 2006 census, Orbost had a population of 2452. Orbost is the service centre for the primary industries of beef, dairy cattle, and sawmilling. More recently, tourism has become an important industry, being the major town close to several national parks, including the Snowy River National Park, Alpine National Park, Errinundra National Park, Croajingolong National Park and Cape Conran Coastal Park.\r\nMedia related to Orbost at Wikimedia Commons\r\nThe Orbost region has four State primary schools, one Catholic primary school, and Orbost Secondary College (Government).\r\nFor most of the 20th century, Orbost was a fairly prosperous local centre for the forestry and agricultural industries and a supply point for smaller towns in the area. In the 1950s and 1960s several new sawmills were opened to exploit the native forests north and east of Orbost. By the 1980s logging of East Gippsland native forests had become an environmental issue. This resulted in the creation or extension of National Parks in the area, and a steady decline in forestry and sawmilling jobs. The general rural decline of the area and its economy saw the railway close in the mid-1980s and the population drop from around 4000 to around 2000 by the start of the 21st century. Logging and forestry continues to be a contentious issue in 2004 and 2005 in the Goolengook Valley, near the Errinundra National Park.\r\nGold was discovered in the mid-1850s in the Bendoc area, in the mountains north of Orbost, which brought an influx of people to the district. By 1868 it was estimated that there was a population of 500 miners and squatters in the vicinity of Bendoc.\r\nPeter Imlay established the Snowy River Station for grazing in 1842, and his brother the Newmerella run nearby. In 1845 the land was sold to Norman McLeod, who named the area after Orbost farm in the northwest of Isle of Skye, in Scotland.\r\nThe town is represented in the sport of Australian rules football by the Orbost-Snowy Rovers in the East Gippsland Football League.[4]\r\nOrbost has a mild temperate climate with warm su',0,-37.707336,148.454887),(7841,'Simpsons Creek','3888','Gippsland -

The remaining Legend Rock is now protected.[4]\r\nMetung is a town in East Gippsland region of Victoria, Australia. The town is 314 kilometres (195 mi) east of the state capital Melbourne and between the larger towns of Bairnsdale and Lakes Entrance. It is on a small peninsula 31 kilometres (19 mi) south-east of Bairnsdale, separating Lake King and Bancroft Bay on the Gippsland Lakes. At the 2006 census, Metung had a population of 1,207.[1]\r\nThe remaining Legend Rock in the marina\r\nThe legend goes that some fishermen made a good catch and ate the fish around their campfire. The fishermen, however, did not share their catch with their dogs, despite having more than enough to eat. As a punishment, the women, who were guardians of social law, turned the greedy men to stone.[4]\r\nGolfers play at the course of the Kings Cove Metung Golf Club on Kings Cove Boulevard.[3]\r\nMetung is a popular holiday spot, near to larger towns but off any main routes itself. Many of the permanent inhabitants commute to work at Bairnsdale or Lakes Entrance.\r\nThe original inhabitants of the area—the Aboriginal Gunai or Kurnai people—told a story about an unusual group of rocks now found alongside the boardwalk in the Metung Marina on Bancroft Bay.

It was rediscovered after 113 years on the ocean floor in June 2007.\r\nCape Schanck is a locality in the Australian state of Victoria. It is the southernmost tip of the Mornington Peninsula and separates the wild ocean waters of Bass Strait from the slightly calmer waters of Western Port.\r\nAlbatrosses (black-browed, Chatham, yellow-nosed, etc.) are occasionally spotted off the cliffs as are short-tailed shearwaters (particularly during their spring migration), black-faced and pied cormorants, kelp gulls and Australasian gannets. The shrubs decorating the area are frequently home to brown thornbills, singing honeyeaters and a number of other passerines. The elusive striated fieldwren has also been known to inhabit the area. Some flora include cushion bushes.\r\nThe location was named in 1800 after Captain John Schank, R.N. by Lieutenant James Grant sailing on the Lady Nelson.[5][6][7][8] Shanck had designed the raised keel (or centreboard) on the Lady Nelson. Nicolas Baudin called it Cap Richelieu when he sailed past on the Géographe on 30 March 1802.[9]\r\nThe most recognisable symbol of Cape Schanck is the Cape Schanck Lighthouse.

The town hosts a fishing competition each March.\r\nDuring the 1870s and 1880s, Gippsland was gradually settled, and connected to the railway network. This reduced Port Albert\'s role as an important transport hub, and the population subsequently decreased.\r\nPort Albert was one of the earliest ports established in Victoria. In 1841 the Gippsland Company investigated the area following favourable reports from explorer Angus McMillan. In May of that year the first settlers arrived.\r\nPort Albert is a coastal town in Victoria, Australia, on the coast of Corner Inlet on the Yarram - Port Albert Road, 82 kilometres (51 mi) kilometres south-east of Morwell, 236 kilometres (147 mi) kilometres south-east of Melbourne, in the Shire of Wellington. At the 2006 census, Port Albert had a population of 248.\r\nDrum Island, around 110 hectares in size, lies off the coast.\r\nInitially the area was known as Seabank or Old Port, but was changed to New Leith when the town started developing, and later changed to Alberton and Port Albert in honour of Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, the husband of Queen Victoria. [2][3]\r\nThe Post Office opened on 1 November 1842 as Alberton (it was renamed Port Albert in 1856) and was the fourth to open in the Port Phillip District.[4] It became the administrative centre of Gippsland and a transport hub for cargo between Melbourne and Van Diemen\'s Land (now Tasmania), thanks to its 250-metre timber jetty. As the Victorian Gold Rush began in the 1850s, traffic through Port Albert increased, bringing prospectors from Europe and China, many of whom were headed for the Dargo goldfields.

The Boakoolawal clan lived in the Kilcunda area south of the Bass River, and the Yowenjerre were west of the Tarwin River along what is now the Bunurong Marine and Coastal Park. Middens containing charcoal and shellfish mark the location of their campsites along the coast.[5][not in citation given]\r\nThe Victorian Desalination Plant is a water desalination plant on the Bass Coast in Dalyston, completed in December 2012 on Lower Powlett Road. The plant is an integral part of Victoria\'s water system, supplying water via a series of pipelines. As a rainfall-independent source of water it complements Victoria\'s existing drainage basins. It produces high quality water. It is a useful resource in times of drought. Booked tours are run and plans are underway for Aquasure to open to the public.[2][not in citation given] The gates open daily for public access to the 225-hectare park and 8 kilometres of walking, horse riding and cycling tracks. The plant is located next to Williamsons Beach[3] and the Wonthaggi Wind Farm.[4]\r\nOther localities in this postcode:\r\nEventually known as ‘Price’s Corner; Dalyston was first settled by the Price family in 1856. Then in 1880 John Daly came to the district. At that time the nearest railway station was at Dandenong. John Daly built a 40 room hotel at ‘Powlett Crossing’ and this license was surrendered to the current ‘Ozone Hotel’ in 1901. The Daly family owned most of the land in the area and subdivided land around the town for business sites. The town became known as Dalyston (Daly\'s town) because of the Daly family and when the railway station had to have a name, Dalyston was chosen.[13]\r\nDalyston has one primary school and children attend secondary college in nearby Wonthaggi or Phillip Island. Also in Wonthaggi; Chisholm TAFE,[14] Bass Coast Specialist School,[15] Bass Coast Adult Education Centre,[16] University of the Third Age (U3A) retirees education centre.[17] and Connecting Skills Australia (CSA) specialist developmental school, support and employment services/training.[18] Plans are underway for a new tertiary education facility.[19]\r\nDalyston station was on the Wonthaggi railway line along the Bass Coast, Victoria. Its primary purpose was to serve the State Coal Mine on what were then known as the Powlett River Coalfields. The line also provided passenger and general goods services. The station train operated from 1910 until the line\'s closure in 1978. Today there is almost no trace left of Dalyston Station; the site of the station is now part of the Bass Coast Rail Trail.[13]\r\nDalyston\'s location on the north shore of Bass Strait gives it an oceanic climate, with the moderating effect of the ocean allowing a narrower temperature range throughout the year compared to other regions in Victoria. Average daily maximum temperatures range from 23.5 °C in summer to 13.5 in winter. Frost is rare, occurring on average 6 mornings a year.[12]\r\nWilliamsons Beach is popular for surf fishing day and night, catching Salmon and Mullet. Powlett River mouth is popular for catching Bream, Perch, Salmon and Mullet.[5][not in citation given]\r\nPowlett River mouth is located next to Williamsons Beach. On Mouth Of Powlett Road there is a path leading to both. Powlett River mouth is located in the province of Kilcunda.[6] Powlett River riparian and wetland is an estuary of national importance due to its ecological values. It is located alongside fertile agricultural land. Powlett River[7] is named after Frederick Powlett, [8] the Commissioner of the Western Port District in 1840 [9]\r\nOther localities nearby:\r\nDalyston /ˈdælistɒn/ is a seaside town located 125 kilometres (78 mi) south east of Melbourne via the South Gippsland and Bass Highways, in the Bass Coast Shire of Gippsland, Victoria, Australia. Known originally as a train station at Powlett River near Wonthaggi, it is now the location of the Victorian Desalination Plant, and at the 2011 census, it had a population of 606. It\'s Bass Coast’s fastest-growing suburb, with the 2011 census showing Dalyston’s population more than doubled from 278 residents in 2006 to 606 in 2011.[1]\r\nOne of Victoria\'s original pubs, the Ozone Hotel on the Bass Highway has been a pub and restaurant/functions venue in its current premises since 1901.[10]\r\nWalking, cycling and horse trotting is the modern use of the old Wonthaggi railway line all year round. It is very flat and begins at Murray Street in Wonthaggi, goes through Dalyston and ends at the roundabout to Phillip Island. It goes through Dalyston at the end of Daly Street, where it crosses over the Powlett River and continues to the right for 2.7 kilometres to go over Bourne Creek trestle bridge at Kilcunda, which has panoramic views of the beach.

The eastern and western parts of Jimboomba are divided by the Logan River; the only bridge within the locality is Payne Bridge on Cusack Lane (27°49′14″S 153°00′15″E﻿ / ﻿27.82068°S 153.00428°E﻿ / -27.82068; 153.00428﻿ (Payne Bridge)). There is a low-level older bridge immediately to the north of Payne Bridge but this cannot be used by vehicular traffic.\r\nThe Queensland government\'s current plan is that Jimboomba will become a major residential area. The Flagstone housing estate at Jimboomba sometimes gets confused with the townships of Flagstone Creek and Upper Flagstone which are decades-old towns in the Lockyer Valley Region.\r\nThere are five schools in Jimboomba:[7]\r\nJimboomba\'s Flagstone housing estate is expected to expand west over the railway line into Undullah and north into South Maclean, New Beith and Greenbank. This is known as the Greater Flagstone development area. The total area encompassed by the project is 7,188 hectares.[13] Final approval for the project was granted in October 2011.[14]\r\nCattle grazing, dairy farming and hobby farms are the historical industries. However, Jimboomba now has a growing industrial area that provides services for vehicles, irrigation and home-water supplies, produce supplies, light manufacturing and landscape gardening.\r\nThe original spelling was Gimboomba, named after a sheep and livestock station based where the township is today, stretching some distance north, east and south to neighbouring areas. Gimboomba is a Gugingin word (the First Australian peoples of the area, of Yugambeh country) meaning place of loud thunder and little rain. A culture trail celebrating First Australian culture is based at a local primary school bearing the name \'Loud Thunder\' paying respect to its traditional owners.\r\n93.1% of people spoke only English at home; the next most common languages were 0.4% German, 0.3% Hmong, 0.3% Cantonese, 0.2% Japanese, 0.2% Spanish.[1]\r\nThe median age of the Jimboomba population was 33 years, 4 years below the national median of 37.[1]\r\nThere are large numbers of horses kept on or near residential properties for riding, for pleasure and for competition.\r\nA number of well-known sporting teams represent the local area, including the Jimboomba Thunder, the rugby league club that plays home games at Jimboomba Park.\r\nJimboomba is a growing town and locality in Logan City, Queensland, Australia.[2][3] In the 2011 census, Jimboomba had a population of 11,387 people.[1]\r\nIn the 2011 census, Jimboomba recorded a population of 11,387 people, 49.6% female and 50.4% male.[1]\r\nJimboomba was serviced by the Beaudesert railway line that was established to service the abattoir in Beaudesert. The line was closed in 1995 and then reopened and operated as a tourist service as far as Logan Village by railway enthusiasts from 1999 until mid-2004. Funds were harder to raise and depleted quickly for the line so it was closed permanently.[6]\r\nJimboomba is home to the Jimboomba X Stadium, Jimboomba\'s own extreme sports outdoor venue. Holding events such events as 2014 QLD Supercross Championship, 2015 QLD Stadium X Series & two rounds of the 2015 Australian Supercross Championship, Jimboomba X Stadium is located at Hills International College grounds. The opening round of the 2016 Australian Supercross Championship is set to be held at the Jimboomba X Stadium on September 17th\r\nJimboomba Provisional School opened on 12 May 1890, becoming Jimboomba State School on 1 June 1900.[4][5]\r\n78.7% of people living in Jimboomba were born in Australia.

This cottage was originally built in 1875 by Patrick Milbanks on his Kerry property, out of local hand hewn timbers, slats and shingle roof. It has four-poster bed, large cedar sideboard and numerous articles that portray the life of the early pioneers. It was donated to the museum by Patrick Milbanks\'s grandchildren and relocated to its present site in 1979.\r\nThe town of Beaudesert is located 46 m above sea level and has an average annual rainfall of around 916 mm per year. The temperature is around 30 degrees in summer and falls to around three degrees in winter. Generally the weather is mild, but some severe storms can arrive each summer.\r\nA bus runs from Beaudesert to Browns Plains and Brisbane on weekdays. Centacare St Mary\'s Community Services and the Beaudesert RSL provide transport for aged, disabled, veterans and hospital/respite requirements.\r\nA number of well-known sporting teams represent the local area, including the Beaudesert Kingfishers who play home games at R.S. Willis Park.\r\nNeville Bonner, the first indigenous Australian to become a member of parliament, attended Beaudesert Primary School.[13]\r\nA petition from railway enthusiasts, and considerable grants of government money, resulted in its re-opening in 1999. Beaudesert Rail operated steam-driven tourist trains on the line for a short while thereafter. The company ceased operating in August 2004 after a series of fires, allegedly lit by sparks from the train, were set along the train line. The company was in debt and has ceased to exist, with the rolling stock liquidated and physical infrastructure demolished. Beaudesert Rail had also been trading while insolvent,[citation needed] resulting in the closure of several local business who had extended them credit.\r\nBeaudesert Special School, Beaudesert State Primary School, Beaudesert State High School, Mcauley College Beaudesert, St Marys Catholic School, as well as pre-schools and childcare centres.\r\nThe Tabragalba Divisional Board was incorporated on 11 November 1879 under the Divisional Boards Act 1879, centred on Beaudesert. With the passage of the Local Authorities Act 1902, Tabragalba became a shire council on 31 March 1903, and on 8 August 1903 was renamed Beaudesert by an Order in Council. Between 23 November 1912 and 14 September 1929, a separate Beaudesert Town Council managed the town itself.\r\nA branch railway line ran from the outer Brisbane suburb of Bethania to Beaudesert and was in regular use from 1886 to 1996. Until 1991 it had served the meat-packing plant on the outskirts of the town.\r\nQueensland and Brisbane Broncos player Andrew Gee was born in Beaudesert.\r\nOn 15 March 2008, under the Local Government (Reform Implementation) Act 2007 passed by the Parliament of Queensland on 10 August 2007, Beaudesert was abolished and became one of only three Queensland councils, alongside Taroom and Tiaro, to be split in two. The Scenic Rim Regional Council was born. The northern area, which while still largely rural was part of Brisbane\'s growth corridor, became part of Logan City, while the southern rural section became part of the Scenic Rim Region alongside the Shire of Boonah.\r\nThe main standard gauge Brisbane-Sydney railway line runs through Bromelton, a few kilometres west of Beaudesert. This line is used by Countrylink\'s Sydney-Brisbane XPT passenger train and Pacific National\'s (owned by Toll and Lang Corp) Brisbane – Sydney, Brisbane – Melbourne, Brisbane – Wollongong and Brisbane – Adelaide and return freight train services. The passenger service no longer stops at Bromelton.\r\nThe town is possibly named after Beau Desert Park, the property of Charles Henry Alexander Paget, 6th Marquess of Anglesey in Staffordshire, England.[2] Yet it is certain that Queensland\'s Beaudesert was named in about 1841 or 1842 by \'Ned Hawkins\', or Edward Brace Hawkins (1821–1849), who was claiming the area as a sheep station on behalf of his employer William Henry Suttor senior (1805–1877) at Bathurst. It is not known why Hawkins picked the name Beaudesert. He was himself born in Newark Upon Trent in Nottinghamshire, the son of Thomas Fitzherbert Hawkins and wife Elizabeth of Bathurst fame, and it does not seem that he or his family had any personal connections to Beaudesert in England. Ned Hawkins moved on, not long after taking up Beaudesert station, to take up Boonara Station in the South Burnett.\r\nThe Beaudesert Shire Tramway to Christmas Creek, Lamington and Rathdowney, operated by the Beaudesert Shire, opened in 1903 and closed in 1944. A local newspaper, the Beaudesert Times was established in 1908.[5]\r\nOn 9 December 1948, an Order in Council abolished the Shires of Nerang, Tamborine and Waterford and included the latter two and part of Nerang into a new Shire of Beaudesert.

The Beaudesert Shire Tramway was extended to Rathdowney in 1911 but closed in 1944.[3] Timber clearing was the first major industry in the area. Cattle grazing and dairy farming are now the main industries.\r\nRathdowney has the following heritage-listed sites:\r\nThe eastern boundary is marked by the Logan River. It is also close to some of the areas of greatest biodiversity in Australia, and a gateway to various National Parks such as Border Ranges National Park and Mount Barney National Park with a variety of lush rainforest, eucalypt forest, mountain heath and other habitats. In the west, where Burnetts Creek enters the Logan is Bigriggen Reserve Park. The park provides camp sites with a kiosk by the river with access available to caravans, motorhomes and buses.[5]\r\nMount Maroon is 12 km west of Rathdowney. At 966 m the summit provides 360 degree views.[6]\r\nCurrently the small town has a police station, a small shop, a pub, a service station, a post office, memorial grounds, information centre, a bowls club and a small school. The Rathdowney Primary School opened in 1912[7] and has a 25 m swimming pool in which every spring and summer the swimming club has races on a Friday night. The swimming club also has swimming training during the week after school.\r\nThere are many tours, farm stays, guest houses and other opportunities available for visitors to experience this region, which is about a 90-minute drive from Brisbane or the Gold Coast. In Autumn every year the population rises by several thousand for one day at the Rathdowney Heritage Festival, organised by the Rathdowney and District Historical Association (RADHA), who also run an information centre with information on natural heritage, indigenous heritage and history of white settlement from the time of the first pioneers to present day.\r\nRathdowney is a small town in south-eastern Queensland, Australia. It is on the Mount Lindesay Highway 32 kilometres (20 mi) south of Beaudesert at the base of the McPherson Range. It is located in the Scenic Rim local government area. At the 2011 census, Rathdowney had a population of 434.[1]',0,-28.210938,152.868157),(8598,'Running Creek','4287','Ipswich Hinterland','Ipswich','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-28.264395,152.910542),(8599,'Augustine Heights','4300','Forest Lake -

As there is no high school in Esk, students from the Esk State School typically attend Toogoolawah State High School in Toogoolawah, Lockyer District High School in Gatton or Lowood State High School in Lowood or private schools in and around Ipswich.[19]\r\nThe town of Esk is contained in the Queensland electoral district of Nanango.\r\nDuring the 2010–2011 Queensland floods, the centre of Esk was flooded when Redbank Creek burst its banks for the first time ever.[10]\r\nEsk is serviced by a Christian radio station on FM 87.6 MHz.\r\nNearby attractions include Lake Somerset and Lake Wivenhoe, both lakes created by dams, and Ravensbourne and Crows Nest National Parks.\r\nThe land around Esk was first explored by Captain Patrick Logan in 1830. The town was established to service the short-lived copper mines of Eskdale and Cressbrook Creek.[4] Settlers moved into the region during the 1840s.\r\nIn July 1941, a Lutheran church was opened.[8]\r\nEsk is approximately 64 kilometres (40 mi) northwest of Ipswich on the Brisbane Valley Highway. It was named after the River Esk in Scotland and England. It is the administrative centre of the Somerset Region.\r\nThe historic Bellevue Homestead is located in the area. Also close by are the peaks Glen Rock and Mount Esk.\r\nThe small town serves as a centre for a rich farming area.\r\nOn 30 November 1920, Dr Graham Butler laid the foundation stone of the Esk War Memorial.[14] The finished memorial was unveiled by General Lachlan Chisholm Wilson on 27 August 1921.[15] The memorial records the names of 462 Shire residents who enlisted during the First World War. It also contains bronze honour rolls bearing the names of 83 local men who died during the war. Four commemorative plaques have subsequently been added to the structure. The war memorial stands in Esk Memorial Park, which also contains a memorial to Captain Logan, who was murdered while exploring the Brisbane Valley in 1830.[16][17]\r\nThe Caboonbah Homestead was destroyed by fire on 10 May 2009.[9]\r\nDairying slowed from the 1960s onwards, which has eventually led to the decline of the town\'s importance as a major rural centre.[4]\r\nIn 1886, the Brisbane Valley railway line reached Esk from Lowood.[4] Several sawmills were built and in 1904 a butter factory opened. The timber industry declined in the 1920s.\r\nMount Esk Post Office opened on 1 February 1874 (a receiving office had been open from 1873) and was renamed Esk by February 1881.[5]\r\nAt the 2006 census, Esk had a population of 1,166.[20]\r\nEsk is a town and locality in the Somerset Region in South East Queensland, Australia.[2][3] In the 2011 census, Esk had a population of 1,755 people.[1]\r\nMedia related to Esk, Queensland at Wikimedia Commons\r\nMount Esk State School was opened on 1 November 1875 and was renamed Esk State School in 1887.[6][7]',0,-27.240421,152.421957),(8772,'Eskdale','4312','Ipswich Hinterland','Ipswich','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-27.155571,152.229000),(8773,'Glen Esk','4312','Ipswich Hinterland','Ipswich','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-27.251246,152.452949),(8774,'Moombra','4312','Ipswich Hinterland','Ipswich','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-27.292792,152.512285),(8775,'Mount Byron','4312','Ipswich Hinterland','Ipswich','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-27.141726,152.650724),(8776,'Mount Hallen','4312','Ipswich Hinterland','Ipswich','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-27.311451,152.411546),(8777,'Murrumba','4312','Ipswich Hinterland','Ipswich','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-27.195577,152.462296),(8778,'Redbank Creek','4312','Ipswich Hinterland','Ipswich','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-27.286186,152.303935),(8779,'Somerset Dam','4312','Ipswich Hinterland','Ipswich','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-27.116432,152.553552),(8780,'Biarra','4313','Ipswich Hinterland','Ipswich','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-27.163924,152.327655),(8781,'Braemore','4313','Ipswich Hinterland','Ipswich','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-27.048687,152.389051),(8782,'Cooeeimbardi','4313','Ipswich Hinterland','Ipswich','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-27.110472,152.486797),(8783,'Cressbrook','4313','Ipswich Hinterland','Ipswich','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-27.092750,152.442327),(8784,'Fulham','4313','Ipswich Hinterland','Ipswich','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-27.054991,152.452869),(8785,'Gregors Creek','4313','Ipswich Hinterland','Ipswich','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-26.960923,152.443153),(8786,'Ivory Creek','4313','Ipswich Hinterland','Ipswich','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-27.036445,152.338913),(8787,'Lower Cressbrook','4313','Ipswich Hinterland','Ipswich','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-27.081488,152.476665),(8788,'Mount Beppo','4313','Ipswich Hinterland','Ipswich','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-27.133336,152.452846),(8789,'Ottaba','4313','Ipswich Hinterland','Ipswich','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-27.141710,152.387349),(8790,'Scrub Creek','4313','Ipswich Hinterland','Ipswich','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-27.031117,152.427722),(8791,'Toogoolawah','4313','Ipswich Hinterland','Ipswich','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-27.087686,152.374900),(8792,'Yimbun','4313','Ipswich Hinterland','Ipswich','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-27.018117,152.368448),(8793,'Ashwell','4340','Ipswich Hinterland','Ipswich','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-27.628455,152.560103),(8794,'Calvert','4340','Ipswich Hinterland','Ipswich','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-27.662777,152.516008),(8795,'Ebenezer','4340','Ipswich Hinterland','Ipswich','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-27.663343,152.635067),(8796,'Grandchester','4340','Ipswich Hinterland','Ipswich','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-27.660536,152.464438),(8797,'Jeebropilly','4340','Ipswich Hinterland','Ipswich','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-27.645932,152.655261),(8798,'Lanefield','4340','Ipswich Hinterland','Ipswich','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-27.647166,152.555186),(8799,'Lower Mount Walker','4340','Ipswich Hinterland','Ipswich','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-27.699670,152.533431),(8800,'Merryvale','4340','Ipswich Hinterland','Ipswich','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-27.803261,152.500686),(8801,'Moorang','4340','Ipswich Hinterland','Ipswich','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-27.916050,152.472317),(8802,'Mount Forbes','4340','Ipswich Hinterland','Ipswich','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-27.747820,152.613984),(8803,'Mount Mort','4340','Ipswich Hinterland','Ipswich','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-27.800998,152.443717),(8804,'Mount Walker','4340','Ipswich Hinterland','Ipswich','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-27.772612,152.536369),(8805,'Mount Walker West','4340','Ipswich Hinterland','Ipswich','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-27.775884,152.509375),(8806,'Rosevale','4340','Ipswich Hinterland','Ipswich','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-27.864183,152.476884),(8807,'Rosewood','4340','Ipswich Hinterland','Ipswich','QLD','The New Oakleigh Mine is located to the town\'s north and was one of the last remaining coal mines in the area at the time of its closure in 2013.\r\nRosewood is a small town and locality in the Bremer Valley, Queensland, Australia.

Twelve people lost their lives and a large number of houses and other buildings were destroyed.[4]\r\nFollowing the floods, Grantham received visits by politicians including Queensland Premier Anna Bligh on numerous occasions. Australia\'s Governor-General Quentin Bryce also visited the town.[5]\r\nIn May 2011, it was announced that the town would be moved to higher ground to prevent future damaging floods.[6] A 935-acre site was purchased so that landholders could be provided a voluntary swap of equivalent-sized blocks. The new site is situated on a hill overlooking Grantham and has permission from the state government to bypass the normal development approval process.[7] Resident of nearby Murphys Creek, Postmans Ridge, Withcott and Helidon have been included in the fast-tracked plan.\r\nGrantham is a town in the Lockyer Valley region of Queensland, Australia. The town is located 100 kilometres (62 mi) west of the state capital, Brisbane. At the 2011 census, Grantham and the surrounding area had a population of 492.[1]\r\nThe area was first settled in 1841, by George Mocatta.[2] In 1866 a railway siding from the main Toowoomba line was opened which assisted in the development of a small settlement. It wasn\'t until the mid-1879s that a railway station was built.[2] A butter factory was established in 1907. The building was replaced in 1926 by a brick building which operated until 1971.[2]\r\nGrantham Post Office opened on 1 January 1890 (a receiving office had been open from 1876).[3]\r\n',0,-27.574836,152.204914),(8872,'Ma Ma Creek','4347','Toowoomba','Toowoomba','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-27.632109,152.187493),(8873,'Mount Whitestone','4347','Toowoomba','Toowoomba','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-27.685163,152.147134),(8874,'Veradilla','4347','Toowoomba','Toowoomba','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-27.592362,152.184734),(8875,'Winwill','4347','Toowoomba','Toowoomba','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-27.607316,152.209477),(8876,'Athol','4350','Darling Downs -

The Historical Village also has a fully operating blacksmith shop, a Heritage Chapel, an original Toowoomba 1928 Dennis Fire Engine, a two cell lock up short term prison from 1903, Model T Fords, and a collection of restored antique radios and appliances. The Danish Flower Art Centre at Highfields hosts a number of displays including a flower barn, Dutch furniture store and operating blacksmith workshop. The Chocolate Cottage is located at the Village Green which sells antiques, art and other specialty items. Across the road from the Village Green is Jacaranda Manor. Within Jacaranda Manor is a coffee shop, fudge factory and bead store. The Davidson Arboretum on Cawdor Road features temperate deciduous ornamentals and conifers. There is also a Bunya pine.[17]\r\nHighfields is both a town and a locality in the Toowoomba Region, Queensland, Australia along the New England Highway.[2][3] It is situated on the Great Dividing Range, slightly north of Mount Kynoch. It serves as a satellite suburb to the city of Toowoomba, accommodating many of Toowoomba businesses\' employees. At the 2011 census, Highfields had a population of 7,946.[1] The ABS also defines a larger growth area, named Highfields, that includes the suburb and several of those surrounding. At June 2015, the estimated urban population for the Highfields urban area was 18,771.[4] It is the fastest growing area in Queensland and also one of the fastest in Australia.[citation needed]\r\nHighfields is also home to a football (soccer) club, Highfields FC, with teams ranging from Under 6\'s to Colts. Highfields also has a regional rugby league club, Highfields Eagles, with teams ranging from Under 7\'s to 16\'s in the juniors and has an under 18\'s, reserve and A grade team in the seniors. Highfields Lions were admitted into the AFL Darling Downs Senior competition in 2010, and now have a competitive club at Senior and Junior level. Highfields is home to the Highfields Redbacks Rugby Union Club. The Redbacks are based at Kuhls Road Oval, and field teams from Under 6\'s to Over 35\'s. Highfields & District Railways Bulldogs Cricket Club are the local cricket club with teams from under 7s - under 16s and D - A grade. Highfields and District Netball Club operates from the newly opened Highfields district sports park. Highfields and Districts Little Athletics Centre operates during the summer months from the AFL oval\r\nIn 1907 the protests of residents resulted in the both the school and the post office returning to the name Highfields.[3][13] Another post office in the Highfields area is now the Geham Post Office.[3] Coming into the 1960s, the Highfield remained a rural community with, at one stage, only 9 children enrolled in the school. However, residential subdivision started to occur in the 1960s, to a point where it is now considered a satellite town of Toowoomba. The school is now one of the largest primary schools in the district.[5][12]\r\nThe Cultural Centre is a large venue for conferences and performances. Also located at the Centre is an outdoor public swimming complex with a large indoor arena holding two volleyball and basketball courts and a gym. Just outside this is the Highfields Library; the library is operated by the Toowoomba Regional Council and is open seven days.[18] On the other side of the Cultural Centre is a skate park.\r\nThe area probably takes its name from the Highfields pastoral run, north of the township.[5] The area was first developed in the 1860s. Initially, there were a number of sawmills in the area, harvesting the local timber.

However, the railway siding created was known as Nobby\'s Siding and the area become known as Nobby. However, the township that was surveyed alongside the railway in 1891 was named Davenport after George Davenport, a former local Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly for Drayton and Toowoomba whose pastoral run was at nearby Headington Hill.[5][6] However, the Railway Department refused to rename the railway station, which created confusion having the railway station and the town with different names, leading to many people continuing to refer to the town as Nobby.[7] Eventually the town\'s name was official changed back to Nobby in 1931.[2][8]\r\nNobby\'s Siding Post Office opened by March 1894 (a receiving office had been open from 1885[9]), was renamed Nobby\'s by 1902 and Nobby by 1908.[10]\r\nMedia related to Nobby, Queensland at Wikimedia Commons\r\nAt the 2006 census, Nobby had a population of 391.[1]\r\nNobby is a small town and locality on the Darling Downs in the Toowoomba Region, Queensland, Australia.[2][3] It is located halfway between Toowoomba and Warwick. In the 2011 census, Nobby had a population of 484 people.[4]\r\nRudd\'s Pub was originally built in 1893 across the road from the Nobby railway station as the Davenport Hotel; the architects were James Marks and Son.[11] Based on local folklore that author Steele Rudd (who lived in Nobby) wrote some of his works in the pub, it was renamed Rudd\'s Pub in the 1980s.[12]\r\nSister Kenny House is a memorial to Sister Elizabeth Kenny who pioneered physiotherapy as a treatment for polio.[13] This small museum holds artefacts relating to her life and therapies.[14]\r\nIt is noted for having been home to two eminent Australians:',0,-27.838719,151.889972),(9061,'Back Plains','4361','Granite Belt','Darling Downs - Maranoa','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-27.894403,151.799775),(9062,'Clifton','4361','Granite Belt','Darling Downs - Maranoa','QLD','The Clifton War Memorial is located on the corner of King and Edward Streets.[3]\r\nClifton Post Office opened on 20 April 1869 (it was known as King\'s Creek for a short period in 1869).[2]\r\nThe Clifton Library is operated by the Toowoomba Regional Council.

The surrounding Darling Downs have fostered a strong agricultural industry for which Warwick, together with the larger city of Toowoomba, serve as convenient service centres. The town had an estimated urban population of 15,505[1] at June 2015.\r\nThe Condamine River often floods, which can disconnect the northern and southern parts of Warwick and close the highways. Gauges that measure river height are used to provide flood alerts to residents. Low-lying land around the river is mostly used for recreation to minimise the damage caused by flooding with most developed areas at higher levels. Queens Park is a major park based around the river and the highway crossing.[6]\r\nThe Warwick War Memorial was built in 1923 and the memorial gates were built in 1924.[12]\r\nThe Warwick central business district is laid out on a grid pattern and lies within one or two blocks of the long main street, Palmerin Street with Grafton Street the major cross-street. The statue of former Queensland Premier Thomas Byrnes is located at their intersection.[5]\r\nThe Cunningham Highway and the New England Highway jointly enter Warwick from the north, cross the Condamine River, and then turn west within the town close to the Warwick central business district. The Cunningham Highway then continues west towards Goondiwindi, while the New England Highway heads south towards Stanthorpe.[5]\r\nNotable people with a connection to Warwick include\r\nOn 29 November 1917, the Warwick Incident occurred, which would lead to the formation of the Australian Commonwealth Police with the first commissioner for Commonwealth Police appointed eight days later.[10] As Prime Minister William Morris Hughes was addressing a crowd at the Warwick railway station, a man in the crowd threw an egg dislodging the Prime Minister\'s hat. Hughes ordered his arrest but the Queensland State policeman present refused to carry out the orders saying that Hughes had no authority over him.\r\nPatrick Leslie and his two brothers originally settled in the area as squatters, naming their run Canning Downs. In 1847 the NSW government asked Leslie to select a site on his station for a township, which was to be called \'Cannington,\' although the name \'Warwick\' was eventually settled on. Land sales were held in 1850, and the first allotment was bought by Leslie.[8] The telegraph to Brisbane was operating by 1861. The 1870s were boom years for this new town. In 1871 the railway reached Warwick,[9] a brewery was built in 1873, then a cooperative flour mill and brickworks were completed during 1874.\r\nA statue of the 12th Queensland Premier Thomas Joseph Byrnes is located on the corner of Palmerin and Grafton Streets.The Thomas Joseph Byrnes Monument was built about 1901.[11]\r\nWarwick was the seat of a series of local government areas, the Borough of Warwick from 1861, Town of Warwick from 1903, City of Warwick from 1936, Shire of Warwick from 1994, and Southern Downs Region from 2008.\r\nThe Warwick Green Belt, on the banks of the Condamine River, features a sculpture of Tiddalik the mythical frog that drank all of the fresh water in a renowned Aboriginal Dreamtime story.[7]\r\nThe Condamine River meanders from the east to the north-west of Warwick. One of its tributaries, Rosenthal Creek, enters Warwick from the south and enters the Condamine within Warwick.[5]\r\nNewspapers in Warwick include the Warwick Daily News, the Warwick and Southern Downs Weekly and the Southern Free Times. Former newspapers include the Warwick Argus which was published from 1879 to 1919, the Warwick Argus and Tenterfield Chronicle and the Warwick Examiner and Times. Radio station 4WK was established in May 1935.[14] Its coverage was gradually extended to Toowoomba, Pittsworth, Millmerran, Clifton, Allora, Stanthorpe, Crows Nest, Highfields, Dalby, Oakey, Tara, Goondiwindi, Boonah, and Esk.

However, as at 2015, there are no scheduled passenger services operating to Stanthorpe railway station.\r\nThe Border Post is the only paid local newspaper servicing the district. The Stanthorpe Border Post is relied upon for its coverage of local news and events.\r\nStanthorpe has a private co-ed catholic school, St. Joseph\'s School, servicing Preparatory to Year 12, as well as 3 main state funded institutions: Stanthorpe State Primary School, servicing Preparatory to Year 7; Stanthorpe State High School, servicing Year 8 to Year 12; and the Queensland College of Wine Tourism. There are also handfuls of smaller state primary schools scattered throughout the region. The towns first Bachelor level tertiary institution, The College of Wine Tourism, was opened in 2007. The college operates in co-operation with the local Stanthorpe State High School,[30] as well as other regional schools, providing secondary, undergraduate, and graduate certification related to wine and tourism industries.[31]\r\nOwing to its elevation, Stanthorpe features a subtropical highland climate. At an altitude of 811 metres (2,661 ft),[2] Stanthorpe holds the record for the lowest temperature recorded in Queensland at −10.6 °C (12.9 °F) on 23 June 1961.[16] Sleet and light snowfalls are occasionally recorded, with the most significant snowfall in over 30 years occurring on 17 July 2015.[17]\r\nThe land within the boundaries of Stanthorpe is primarily used for urban purposes: housing, recreational, commercial and industrial with some undeveloped land on the hillier slopes. Although an agricultural centre of the Granite Belt, there is little agriculture within the town\'s boundaries.[3] Crops grown in the surrounding area include vegetables, apples, grapes and stone fruit. Wine is also produced in the area, and sheep and cattle grazing is also prevalent.\r\nThe railway reached Stanthorpe in May 1881.[5]\r\nStanthorpe and the surrounding Granite Belt and Granite Highlands area of South East Queensland and Northern New South Wales are the centre of a booming winery and national parks tourist destination. There are more than 50 wineries in the Granite Belt area, with a wide range of restaurants, Accommodation places and tourist venues. The Granite Belt national parks are Girraween, Bald Rock, Sundown, Boonoo Boonoo. Wine and tourism are a very important part of the town\'s economy, with the region operating its own wine and tourism marketing body named Granite Belt Wine Country. Backpacking is popular and there is large demand for fruit and vegetable pickers from November until May each year.[27] Storm King Dam offers some good angling opportunities for Murray cod, yellowbelly and silver perch.\r\nThe cool dry climate was valued as an aid to health from the early nineteenth century especially for those suffering from tuberculosis or chest conditions. Following the First World War, Stanthorpe was a major resettlement area for soldiers recovering from mustard gas exposure. Many of these Soldier Settlers took up the land leased to them in the areas around Stanthorpe which now bear the names of First World War battlefields.\r\nStanthorpe is also serviced by a Christian radio network rebroadcasting on FM 88.0 MHz. It features programs about health, lifestyle, children\'s programs and interesting interviews.\r\nStanthorpe is a town situated in south east Queensland, Australia. The town lies on the New England Highway near the New South Wales border 223 kilometres (139 mi) from Brisbane via Warwick, 56 kilometres (35 mi) north of Tenterfield and 811 m above sea level.[2] The area surrounding the town is known as the Granite Belt. At the 2011 census, Stanthorpe had a population of 7003538500000000000♠5385.[1]\r\nThe Stanthorpe area is served by a local Community Radio Station Ten FM. The Station is currently transmitting on 98.7 MHz with a low power transmitter situated on Mount Marlay. The station has in 2011 upgraded its Stanthorpe studios with a new mixing desk, new computers and professional grade monitor speakers. Ten FM has a local focus, derived in part from the stringent rules controlling Community Radio Stations. The station transmits a broad range of programs to attract the widest audience. In particular, the station broadcasts Italoz, a weekly program with an Italian theme to cater for the many listeners around the Stanthorpe area with an Italian background.\r\nStanthorpe was developed around Quart Pot Creek which meanders from south-east through the centre of town and then out through the south-west, where its confluence with Spring Creek forms the Severn River. Quart Pot Creek forms part of the south-western boundary of the locality, while the Severn River forms part of the south-western boundary.[3]\r\nStanthorpe Library and Regional Art Gallery is Lock Street beside Weeroona Park ( WikiMiniAtlas28°39′13″S 151°55′57″E﻿ / ﻿28.6537°S 151.9326°E﻿ / -28.6537; 151.9326﻿ (Stanthorpe Library and Art Gallery)).

It is 878 m above sea level. There is a gap between the more Westerly range at Wyberba, about five kilometres north of Wallangarra. This gap has made Wallangarra the major inland border crossing for the New England Highway and what was the first railway line between Brisbane and Sydney.\r\nWallangarra is situated on the picturesque Granite Belt, and is bounded by Sundown National Park to the West and Girraween National Park to the East.\r\nThe Wallangarra cemetery is in McCall Street.\r\nWallangarra has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:\r\nRugby League legend Billy Moore lived in Wallangarra as a child. He is best known for playing for the North Sydney Bears and the Queensland State of Origin team. He was born in Tenterfield, New South Wales as this was the closest hospital.[12]\r\nWallangarra is a town and locality in the Southern Downs Region, Queensland, Australia.[2][3] It is the third most southerly town in Queensland, 258 kilometres (160 mi) south west of Brisbane. Wallangarra is on the Queensland side of the border and Jennings is on the New South Wales side. At the 2006 census, Wallangarra had a population of 385.[1]\r\nAs of 2013, the Wallangarra Stores Depot remained a major Australian Army logistics facility. It is used to store a wide range of engineering and general equipment, clothing, and tents. Bulk fuel storage handling apparatus are also held at the site.[10] The munitions storage facility is also still active in Jennings.[11]\r\nUntil 1982 The Anderson Meat Packing Company operated a large beef abattoir at Wallangarra. Anderson\'s employed in excess of 400 workers at the Wallanagarra plant. The plant was located on the border so as to take advantage of rail lines from both Queensland and NSW.\r\nIn 1885, the Queensland government announced that a town would be formed where the railway line between Queensland and New South Wales would meet. On 29 June 1885, 179 lots were offered for sale at £8 per acre (£20/ha).[4]\r\nDuring World War II, the Commonwealth Government created a general army store on the Queensland side of the border, and an ammunition dump on the New South Wales side. Dual gauge tracks were run to each store.\r\nWallangarra is one of the coldest towns in Queensland, due to its altitude and extreme southerly location in the state. Maximum temperatures rarely rise above 15 °C (59 °F) in winter or above 30 °C (86 °F) in summer. Wallangarra holds the record for the lowest maximum temperature in Queensland, 2.4 °C (36 °F) on 3 July 1984.[5] Despite this, minimum temperatures are not as low due to local geographic variations, and towns well to the north such as Warwick and Oakey frequently record lower minimums.\r\nAfter this closed the town\'s future looked dim. Ten years later, however, Australia\'s largest mutton works opened on a new site just to the east of the town. The mutton produced is Halal, and most of it is exported to Arab countries.\r\nAccess to the army stores was via Margetts St, one of the main roads in the town. The late Muriel Daphne Verdun Nicolson lived at 30 Margetts St from before WWII until her death in 2001. During WWII she reported that the flow of trucks and materiel went on all day and night.\r\nThe railway line from Stanthorpe to Wallangarra has continued to be maintained and steam trains taking tourists to Wallangarra occasionally operate.\r\nDespite being declared as Wallangarra, the station itself has the Queensland name boards hyphenated as Wallan-Garra.[8]\r\nThe town was created to service a break-of-gauge between Queensland\'s narrow gauge Southern railway line of 3 ft 6 in (1,067 mm) and New South Wales\'s standard gauge Main North railway line of 4 ft 8 1⁄2 in (1,435 mm) when the two systems came together in 1888.[6] The railway was the only rail link between Queensland and New South Wales until a standard gauge track was completed in 1932, with the completion of the bridge at Grafton. From that time on, the Wallangarra station lessened in importance. All scheduled rail services stopped in 1997.[7] In 2003, after major refurbishment, the station was reopened as a museum.\r\nDrive out along Margetts St, over the railway bridge, past the Rugby League grounds and out past the army. From there follow Old Paling Yard Road up the foot hills of Mt Norman. There you will find a water treatment plant and a road branch to the left going down to Beehive dam. Beehive dam is in the mountains, and fed by a spring. It is a beautiful place for a picnic.\r\nTaking advantage of the rail junction Riverina Stock Feeds operated a packing plant opposite the Wallangarra railway station for many years until 1995. After that it moved to Warwick, a city 100 kilometres (62 mi) to the north. Warwick also has a major Woolworths warehouse. Interestingly the Chairman of Woolworths who located the warehouse at Warwick grew up in Wallangarra.',0,-28.882394,151.910698),(9168,'Limevale','4384','Darling Downs (West) - Maranoa','Darling Downs - Maranoa','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-28.728006,151.183208),(9169,'Beebo','4385','Inverell - Tenterfield','New England and North West','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-28.722738,150.967237),(9170,'Bobs Creek','2443','Port Macquarie','Mid North Coast','NSW','Not yet populated',0,-31.584673,152.744357),(9171,'Glenarbon','4385','Inverell - Tenterfield','New England and North West','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-28.660778,150.842509),(9172,'Maidenhead','4385','Inverell - Tenterfield','New England and North West','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-29.140441,151.383560),(9173,'Riverton','4385','Inverell - Tenterfield','New England and North West','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-29.064236,151.484856),(9174,'Silver Spur','4385','Inverell - Tenterfield','New England and North West','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-28.863823,151.277716),(9175,'Smithlea','4385','Inverell - Tenterfield','New England and North West','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-28.808137,151.046597),(9176,'Texas','4385','Inverell - Tenterfield','New England and North West','QLD','Texas was connected by the Texas railway line from Inglewood in November 1930 with the town being served by the Texas railway station.[5] The line was closed in 1994.\r\nTexas is serviced by the Warwick Daily News and Stanthorpe Border Post newspapers. Texas is served by the Border Districts Community Radio Station 89.7 Ten FM which is transmitted from a 4 kW transmitter located on Mt Mackenzie Tenterfield NSW.\r\nThe town is located just 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) from Queensland\'s southern border with New South Wales, close to Bonshaw, New South Wales.\r\nTexas sits on Bigambul land, the Indigenous people of the region inhabited the area for thousands of years prior to colonisation in the 1840s.\r\nAfter a visit to Texas in 2002, and being involved in a car accident nearby, American Country/Rockabilly recording artist Jason Lee Wilson memorialised the town in a song TX, QLD, Australia. The song was included on the Cumberland Runners\' 2004 debut album entitled Music to Haul By.\r\nUp until about 1986, tobacco farming was an important industry in the area and many Italian families settled the area to run and work the tobacco farms.\r\nFarming is the dominant industry in the Texas region, although there is also a silver mine. A large cattle feedlot is located about 20 mins from town.\r\nPreviously, James Blundell had written and recorded a song entitled Texas as the B-side of his first single on the EMI label (EMI 2165), Cloncurry Cattle Song. On the single the writing credits of the two songs were inadvertently switched, but corrected on Blundell\'s debut, self-titled album (1989). Texas was composed by James Blundell and Doug Trevor, with Blundell and M. Hickson writing Cloncurry Cattle Song.\r\nTexas has a state school called Texas State School,[7] which caters to students from Prep Year to Year 10.\r\nTexas is a town and locality in the Goondiwindi Region, Queensland, Australia.[3][4] In the 2011 census, Texas had a population of 1,159 people.[1]\r\nMedia related to Texas, Queensland at Wikimedia Commons\r\nLee Kernaghan also referenced the town in his 2002 hit song Texas, Qld 4385 from his Electric Rodeo album released in 2002.\r\nAt the 2006 census, Texas had a population of 693.[6]\r\nAt 2013 Texas is serviced by two petrol stations. The Shell Branded service station sells both regular and premium (greater than 95 octane) unleaded petrol. The BP service station, whilst not displaying BP signage does accept BP account cards. The BP does not sell premium unleaded.\r\nPart of the Goondiwindi Regional Council, Texas is administered from the nearby larger town of Goondiwindi, Queensland.\r\nThe origin of the town\'s name is generally regarded as a reference to a territorial dispute. The land in the area was first settled by the McDougall brothers, who found squatters there on returning from the goldfields. Once their legal right to the land was recognised, they named their property in honour of the rather more famous dispute between the United States and Mexico over territory in Texas, USA.[3]\r\nTexas has a public library, museum and cultural centre, swimming pool, bowling club, golf course, showground and a racecourse.[9] The town also has a 809m runway.[10]',0,-28.871596,151.163669),(9177,'Watsons Crossing','4385','Inverell - Tenterfield','New England and North West','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-29.120687,151.315348),(9178,'Brush Creek','4387','Darling Downs (West) - Maranoa','Darling Downs - Maranoa','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-28.606093,151.126671),(9179,'Bybera','4387','Darling Downs (West) - Maranoa','Darling Downs - Maranoa','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-28.280370,150.886064),(9180,'Coolmunda','4387','Darling Downs (West) - Maranoa','Darling Downs - Maranoa','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-28.408356,151.212890),(9181,'Greenup','4387','Darling Downs (West) - Maranoa','Darling Downs - Maranoa','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-28.493536,151.306073),(9182,'Inglewood','4387','Darling Downs (West) - Maranoa','Darling Downs - Maranoa','QLD','Inglewood is a town situated on the southern Darling Downs in Queensland, Australia, 150 km (93 mi) south-west of Toowoomba. Inglewood is the second largest town in the Goondiwindi Region as well as being part of the Border Rivers region of waterways.\r\nInglewood\'s main attraction is Lake Coolmunda, 13 km (8.1 mi) east of town. The lake is a popular location for water skiing, sailing, canoeing, fishing, camping and bird watching.[7] The Inglewood & District Historical Society runs a small exhibit in the Inglewood Heritage Centre showcasing the history of exploration, settlement, education, culture, agriculture, industry and transportation in the area.[8]\r\nThe current slogan for the town is \'Catch the country spirit\'.\r\nThe town was the council seat of the former Shire of Inglewood until its amalgamation to form part of the larger Goondiwindi Region.\r\nOn 16 February 1922, the Inglewood War Memorial was dedicated by the Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly for the Carnarvon, Major Edward Costello, as part of at the official opening of the Inglewood Memorial Hospital.[5]\r\nInglewood has a public library open to the community, a Civic Centre which hosts local events and plays, sports grounds, tennis courts, swimming pool, golf course, and bowling club.[9]\r\nInglewood has two schools:\r\nIn 1925, Pugh\'s Queensland Directory recorded four hotels in Inglewood, two sawmills, a picture show and several other stores and tradespeople.[4]\r\nBecause Inglewood only offers schooling up to Year 10, students often travel daily to Goondiwindi or attend boarding schools in Warwick, Toowoomba and Brisbane to complete their senior years.\r\nIn 1907 Inglewood was connected by Rail transport|rail to Warwick, and westward to Goondiwindi by the South Western railway line. Nine years later Inglewood became a rail junction when the line to Texas was opened. It carried freight, including fuel to, and ore from, the Silverspur mine east of Texas. The Texas rail line was closed in 1994, due to lack of passengers and the usage of trucks to move freight. Local dairying was served by a branch factory of the Warwick Co-operative between 1940 and 1960.\r\nThe town sits midway between the larger centres of Warwick and Goondiwindi on the Cunningham Highway. The confluence of the Macintyre Brook and Canning Creek is sited just north of Inglewood, with the brook running 270° around the town.[6] Olive growing is a comparatively new industry in the area. Other established industries include sheep and cattle raising, grain growing and timber harvesting. Tobacco growing was common around Inglewood over the last 60 years.\r\nEnglish botanist and explorer Allan Cunningham has been credited with being the first European to discover the Inglewood area. He passed through east of the present township in May 1827. The first settlement in the area was known as Browns Inn and was an important watering point for bullock teams moving west. The inn opened in the late 1850s on the south side of Macintyre Brook, and in 1862 a town was surveyed on the higher, northern side. Plans were drawn up for the present site and the name changed to Inglewood. Inglewood Post Office opened on 16 September 1866.[2] Most of the hinterland consisted of station holdings which were selected as early as 1848 and were the start of the wool, cattle and wheat base of the region. A school was opened in 1872 and a hospital was built in 1921. Anglican, Catholic and Presbyterian churches opened in 1894, 1902 and 1906 respectively.[3]',0,-28.414838,151.081895),(9183,'Mosquito Creek','4387','Darling Downs (West) - Maranoa','Darling Downs - Maranoa','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-28.232196,151.274358),(9184,'Terrica','4387','Darling Downs (West) -

On 1 January 1865, Mitchell Downs Post Office opened and around 1878 was renamed Mitchell Post Office.[7]\r\nThe water supply for the town comes from three bores. The depth of the bores is about 1,000 metres. The water is pumped into a large concrete water tower on the western side of the town. The water is hot when it emerges from the ground, and in the tank it is about 50 °C. Houses close to the tank, have free hot water. In fact it is necessary to cool the water before it can be used.\r\nMitchell was once the administrative centre of the Shire of Booringa local government area. Since 2008, the town is now part of the Maranoa Region.\r\nDaniel Casey, often referred to as Dan Casey, was a lawyer born in Mitchell QLD in 1899.

At the 2006 census, Thargomindah had a population of 203.[1]\r\nThargomindah was one of the first towns in Australia to produce hydroelectric power from 1898 until 1951, which then was taken over by diesel generators until 1988. The town was later connected to the national power grid via Cunnamulla. The old bore was a source of energy when electric street lights were lit and coupled to a turbine driven by the bore\'s natural water pressure. The generator was taken from a unit powered by a steam engine and purchased by the Bulloo Divisional Board becoming the first municipality owned power plant. The power station is still operating with a daily opening to the public.\r\nThe town was first settled in the 1860s at a crossing of the Bulloo River.[5] A post office was established in 1870 and a telegraph line connected the town to Cunnamulla in 1881.

North','QLD','The Aboriginal people of the Brisbane River Valley and Kilcoy region are the Jinibara People, traditionally a nation of five clans: the Dungidau centred in the Kilcoy region and the junction of the Stanley and Brisbane Rivers; the Dal:a or Dallumbara clan inhabiting the Conondale Range west to the Brisbane River; the Gurumngar around the southern end of the D’Aguilar Range; the Nalbo along the Maleny-Mapleton escarpment and the Dungibara on the Upper Brisbane River.[4][5]\r\nThe Kilcoy region is a rich Aboriginal cultural landscape. Mount Archer was known as Buruja, and also the name of a wetland near Villeneuve that was one of the main camps of the Dungidau clan. Bora rings existed at ‘Wellcourt’ on Somerset Dam and at Sandy Creek east of Kilcoy, Oaky Creek and Waraba Creek.[8]\r\nIn the 1960s, road transport ensured the demise of the railway line (1964) and the old Kilcoy yard was converted many years later into a park known as Yowie Park.[18] Deregulation of the dairy industry has caused a lot of these small farms to become unviable. The total population for the wider area serviced by the town at the 2011 Australian Census was 4,840.[25]\r\nKilcoy was the heartland of the Jinibara People and the name comes from a patch of lawyer cane (jini) on Mount Kilcoy;[6] ‘bara’ means’ people’ or ‘folk’; thus Jinibara are the ‘People of the Lawyer cane’. Kilcoy was known as Bumgur, meaning the ‘blue cod’.[7]\r\nKilcoy is a town and locality in the Somerset Region local government area in South East Queensland, Australia.[2][3] At the 2011 Australian Census the town recorded a population of 1,714.[1]\r\nKilcoy became a thriving, prosperous town providing all the services required to maintain all needs of the district. With distance travel still not largely contemplated, nor in most cases desired or even possible, countless local and strongly-supported social, sporting and community-based clubs and organizations were established, revolving around the mounting interest in pastimes such as cricket, tennis, football, golf, rifle shooting, draughts, automobiles (1926), horse racing, eisteddfod, choral and a Masonic Lodge (1907).\r\nThe site of the \'Town of Kilcoy\' was surveyed by W. E. Hill by April 1888, and the first land sale was on 6 November that year.[12] On 1 December 1892, a post office was opened at Kilcoy, and named Hopetoun post office, after Louis Hope. The township was referred to unofficially as Hopetoun until in 1908 the post office name was changed to Kilcoy, and the town\'s real name came back into general use.[12] Captain Hope was the uncle of the first Governor General of Australia, Lord Hopetoun, who was a visitor to Kilcoy Station.[17]\r\nThe junction of the Brisbane and Stanley Rivers was known as Gunundjin, meaning a ‘hollow place’, and a sacred place, called Gairnbee Rock, recalled a dreaming story of a girl who went swimming there and was turned by her father, a gundir (clever man) by magic into a rock to save her from a dangerous evil spirit.[9] The Stanley River was also called Gairnbee, meaning the water gum.[10] The Brisbane River was known as Mairwar or Mairrwarrh, meaning ‘platypus’ in Dungidau.\r\nA sand mining operation was proposed for the town in 2011,[26] but the application was withdrawn on 31/10/2012 following strong opposition by the local residents.\r\nTowards the end of the 1800s large properties and Government leases began to be divided up for closer settlement. Blocks capable of supporting a family were eagerly sought after, fenced and cleared. The main source of income for these settlers was dairying and they worked hard against the elements to ensure they were self-sufficient. By the 1890s the only original lease country left was in the Mt Kilcoy and Sandy Creek districts, part of Durundur Station. This country was not opened for settlement until 1902.[18] Surveyed in 1888, the township quickly developed at the junction of Sheep Station and Kilcoy Creeks to service these settlers and their families.[12] It was originally named Hopetoun but was later changed to Kilcoy to avoid incorrect mail distribution to other towns of the same name in Victoria and Western Australia.[12]\r\nKilcoy has a number of heritage-listed sites, including Kilcoy Homestead on Kilcoy-Murgon Road.[30]\r\nSomerset Dam was constructed between 1935 and 1959 with suspension of construction during the Second World War. The dam is situated on the Stanley River approximately 220 kilometres (140 mi) upstream from the mouth of the Brisbane River. Construction of the Somerset Dam created jobs and in 1953 Kilcoy Pastoral Company established the meat works and has steadily increased production to what it is today.[23]\r\nIn 1842 on the outskirts of Kilcoy Station owned by MacKenzie, 30–60 Native Aborigines of the Gubbi Gubbi tribe (also known as Kabi Kabi) died from eating flour laced with strychnine or arsenic.[15][16]\r\nMost of Kilcoy\'s residents are employed servicing the surrounding pastoral area.

Most rain falls during the height of summer, between November and February. Whilst summer maximum average temperatures generally linger around 30C, the summer months, like most of South East Queensland have some extremely hot days, sometimes as high as 40C.\r\nMt Samson was occupied by the indigenous people who named it Buran (Boorun), which means wind.[2]\r\nMount Samson is a blend of acreage properties and small farms.

Samsonvale sits below the highest peak in the area, Mount Samson.\r\nSamsonvale began as a pastoral run in 1845 predominately of the Joyner family, after whom [3] a nearby suburb is named.[4]\r\nThe construction of the North Pine Dam and the flooding of Lake Samsonvale in the 1970s caused a series of forced resumptions of family farms. The flooding of the Lake also closed the Presbyterian Church, community hall, and post office.\r\nFor the first half of the last Century Samsonvale was predominantly a dairy farming community centered on a station on the Dayboro railway line.\r\nSamsonvale was occupied by the indigenous people, who named the area Tukuwompa.[2]\r\nIn the 2011 census, Samsonvale recorded a population of 555 people, 49.2% female and 50.8% male.[1] The median age of the Samsonvale population was 38 years, 1 year above the national median of 37. 83.8% of people living in Samsonvale were born in Australia.

it seems, one of forced resumptions with three quarters of the Joyner\'s original pastoral run in the 1860s being taken from them.[4]\r\nThe current Samsonvale Rural Fire Brigade facility sits above what was once the center of the Kobble Creek community.\r\nIn 2006, during a drought seeing water levels of Lake Samsonvale falling to unprecedented lows, archeological works were considered by the local council to preserve historic artifacts from flooded homesteads dating back to the 19th Century.[6] In 2010 Lake Samsonvale is once again filled to capacity, covering the historical sites and much of the district\'s best farming land.\r\nAll that remains today at the site of the old village is a cemetery with much of the former district underwater, along with the original Samsonvale

The town was the administrative centre of Monto Shire. At the 2006 census, Monto had a population of 1,159.[1]\r\nMonto has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:\r\nTourism is also a major industry in the region. Besides being a major highway town, the chief local attractions are Cania Gorge National Park and Cania Dam, 20 kilometres (12 mi) north of town.\r\nMonto has a public library, a cultural and historical complex with a museum reserve, sporting facilities, swimming pool and golf club\r\nEuropeans settled in the area in the late 1840s, maintaining large pastoral holdings at the northern end of the Burnett Valley. Gold unearthed along Three Moon Creek — a tributary of the Burnett River — in the 1870s attracted further settlers. The original site of the diggings, 30 kilometres (19 mi) north of present-day Monto, has since been flooded by construction of Cania Dam. The township of Monto was not formally established until 1924 in which year the post office opened.[3] With dwindling gold reserves, Monto turned its economy towards farming and logging, two of the region\'s major industries today. Deposits of thermal coal and limestone have been discovered in the shire.\r\nIn 2006, Monto Minerals floated on the Alternative Investment Market in London, raising approximately A$41 million before expenses.[5] It has since announced its plans to begin commercial production of Feldspar, Ilmenite, Apatite and Titanomagnetite from its site at the Goondicum crater, just outside the eastern border of Monto Shire by the second quarter of 2007.[6]\r\nCoal mining company Macarthur Coal also owns large amounts of land in the Mulgildie area.',0,-24.863085,151.121559),(9980,'Moonford','4630','Burnett','Wide Bay','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-24.761327,151.035987),(9981,'Mulgildie','4630','Burnett','Wide Bay','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-24.964665,151.131573),(9982,'Mungungo','4630','Burnett','Wide Bay','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-24.766974,151.163581),(9983,'Rawbelle','4630','Burnett','Wide Bay','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-25.027406,150.830200),(9984,'Selene','4630','Burnett','Wide Bay','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-24.993127,151.141216),(9985,'Splinter Creek','4630','Burnett','Wide Bay','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-24.929556,151.226111),(9986,'Tellebang','4630','Burnett','Wide Bay','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-25.009217,151.269144),(9987,'Three Moon','4630','Burnett','Wide Bay','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-24.918977,151.133102),(9988,'Ventnor','4630','Burnett','Wide Bay','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-24.906604,151.297576),(9989,'Yarrol','4630','Burnett','Wide Bay','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-25.130077,151.352134),(9990,'Aldershot','4650','Gympie -

Pastoralists established properties soon after to raise cattle on the fertile lands. Back then, sugar was (as it is now) the key crop grown in the Isis. The town was established in 1885. The Isis railway line to Childers opened in 1887 and was pivotal in the early development of the area. Childers Post Office opened on 14 November 1887.[2] The town is reportedly named after Hugh Childers, British statesman, who was the Auditor-General of Victoria in the 1850s.[3] The railway line closed in 1964.\r\nChilders holds a Multicultural Festival once a year on the final weekend in July.[31] The town also hosts an agricultural show; which in the past was held in early August, but is now hosted in late May or early June.\r\nChilders acts as a major economic centre in the Wide Bay-Burnett Region and is undergoing considerable growth.\r\nThe township is set on a ridge overlooking fields of rich volcanic soil. Childers is renowned for its heritage character and is classified a National Trust town. The historic colonial buildings of the main street (Bruce Highway) are set amongst large, shady leopard trees. The sugar cane industry features prominently in Childers and has sustained the town over the years. Fruit and vegetable cropping is common on the lands around town. Tourism is a growing industry in Childers, with a number of the preserved historic buildings in town becoming tourist attractions.\r\nChilders has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:\r\nThe Isis Town and Country is the town\'s local newspaper, available once a week on Thursday. Childers is also served by a monthly community newspaper, the Childers Chit Chat, as well as its own radio station, 88.0FM Red Dirt Radio and commercial radio station Rebel 106.7.\r\nChilders has seen a number of serious fires over the years. The 1902 fire destroyed much of the town centre. The town made international headlines in June 2000, when an arsonist set fire to the Palace Backpackers Hostel, claiming the lives of 15 tourists. The Palace Building reopened in 2002, and includes a memorial to those lost in the blaze, a Regional Art Gallery and an Information Centre.\r\nEducation in Childers consists of several primary schools, as well as the local high school, Isis District State High School. In addition, the town services the surrounding areas with its small hospital. Childers has its own courthouse. The town has several emergency service faculties including a police station, ambulance station and fire station housing Fire and Rescue Queensland Staff and Queensland Rural Fire Service volunteers. It also hosts a branch of the State Emergency Service and PCYC Emergency Services Cadets program\r\nChilders retains much of its historic significance, although many of the streets were redeveloped under a \'Streetscape\' project that continues today.\r\nChilders has many general local services including a branch of Bundaberg Regional Libraries, an art gallery (Bundaberg Regional Art Gallery- BRAG) and Information Centre. Cultural entertainment facilitated through the Childers Cultural Centre- a town hall hired through the Bundaberg Regional Council.\r\nChilders is a town in the Wide Bay-Burnett region of Queensland, Australia, situated on the Bruce Highway and lies 325 kilometres (202 mi) north of the state capital Brisbane and 52 kilometres (32 mi) south-west of Bundaberg.

which included Boyne Island, Tannum Sands, Ambrose, Mount Larcom and most of the industrial plants plus Awoonga dam. Calliope has now become one of the towns under the umbrella of the Gladstone Regional Council after the merger of the Calliope Shire Council and the former Gladstone City Council. GRC still maintain significant offices in Calliope.\r\nMedia: Calliope is serviced by Christian FM radio 87.6FM.\r\nThe Gladstone Area Water Board operates a fish hatchery which breeds barramundi and mangrove jack for release into Lake Awoonga. Barramundi over 20 kg (44.09 lbs) are regularly caught, and the heaviest caught by August 2008 weighed in at a hefty 36.5 kg (80.47 lbs). In addition, the mangrove jack breeding program has resulted in Lake Awoonga holding the largest stocks in Australia with over 13,000 released. Since 1996 over two and a half million barramundi fingerlings and 340,000 mullet fingerlings have been released into Lake Awoonga.[6]\r\nLake Awoonga is home to a thriving array of native animals, several of which are of conservation significance. Two fauna species are listed as vulnerable: the yellow-bellied glider and the grey-headed flying fox. For the bird-watching enthusiast, Lake Awoonga is a paradise with more than 225 species or over 27% of Australia\'s bird species found in the region. The southern squatter pigeon [4] is listed as vulnerable and of conservation significance, and twenty-seven species are listed on International Migratory Conservation Agreement lists.[5] Lake Awoonga is arguably one of the most important near-coast bird refuges on the East Coast of Australia.\r\nThe Port Curtis Historical Village is situated on the banks of the Calliope River, as well as the Boyne River. Lake Awoonga resulted from the construction of a dam on the Boyne River. Lake Awoonga supplies water to the city of Gladstone, and Calliope and other townships in the region, as well as supplying the major industries for which the Gladstone region is known. Total capacity of Lake Awoonga is 777,000 megalitres (203,412,500,000 gallons). The catchment area contributing to the Lake is 2,240 square kilometres (864.87 square miles) and is surrounded by the Boyne, Dawes and Many Peaks Ranges.\r\nCalliope has an 18-hole golf course with club and a bowls club. There are two pubs and an annual rodeo held each year. The town also has a swimming pool, racecourse, sports fields, Hazelbrook Park and a skateboard ramp.\r\nCalliope State School is a government co-educational Primary (Prep to Year 6) School at Stirrat Street, Calliope.[11] In 2015 the Calliope State School had 588 students enrolled with a teaching staff of 38 FTE (Full time equivalent) and 15 FTE (Full time equivalent) non-teaching staff. Students from Calliope State School come from a wide range of socio-economic backgrounds with an ICSEA of 977 (35th percentile) in 2015. · Approximately 4% of the students identify as being Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander decent.[12]\r\nRecent years have seen the introduction of a child care centre, supermarket shopping, specialty stores, doctors surgeries and other essential services. A large number of new homes and town houses have been built in Calliope due to its proximity to Gladstone Port and associated industries such as LNG.[7][8]\r\nCalliope is a town located in Central Queensland, Australia. It is located near the \'cross-roads\' of the Bruce Highway and the Dawson Highway, 20 kilometres (12 mi) SSW of the port city of Gladstone. At the 2011 census, Calliope had a population of 3,058.[1]\r\nThe Calliope Library is on Don Cameron Drive; it is operated by the Gladstone Regional Council.[9] There is a Gladstone Regional Council administration centre at 5 Don Cameron Drive.[10]\r\nThe town is reputedly named after the ship Calliope, which brought the Governor of New South Wales, Sir Charles Augustus FitzRoy to Port Curtis in 1854. Industries of the town and surrounds since that time have included gold mining, beef, timber, and more recently heavy industry (Aluminium, Coal, LNG), shipping and tourism.\r\nCalliope Post Office opened on 1 March 1864.[2] Alluvial gold was mined in the area after its discovery in 1862. The following year Queensland\'s first goldfield was officially proclaimed.[citation needed] In 1872, a state primary school was opened.[3]\r\n',0,-24.007070,151.200583),(10214,'Clinton','4680','Gladstone','Central Queensland','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-23.875755,151.219622),(10215,'Curtis Island','4680','Gladstone','Central

In 2012, there were 37 students enrolled with 3 teachers (2.5 full-time equivalent).

The school closed in 1935, but reopened on 25 January 1960.[8][9][10]\r\nThe post office at Banana was established on 1 September 1861.[6][7]\r\nBanana is located at the intersection of the Dawson and Leichhardt highways, 46 kilometres (29 mi) west of the shire\'s administrative centre, Biloela.\r\nAt the time of the Canoona rush, gold was found in Banana\'s Gully (as it was then called) and a town of at least 2,000 people sprang up there.[4]\r\nThe town was named in the early 1860s. The name derives from an old dun-coloured working bullock, called Banana, used by local stockmen to help them when herding some of the wilder cattle into the yards.[2][4][5]\r\nBanana is a small town and rural locality in the Shire of Banana, Central Queensland, Australia.[2][3] In the 2011 census, Banana had a population of 377 people.[1]\r\nThe beef industry is still a mainstay of the town and area, along with coal and agriculture.\r\nAt the 2006 census, Banana had a population of 627.[15]\r\nIn 1880, the local government area Banana Division (later the Shire of Banana) was established with its headquarters in Banana (taking its name from the town). However, in 1930 the shire headquarters became Rannes and the shire offices were physically relocated from Banana to Rannes.

Although the area was named Prestone on the original survey plan, Queensland Governor George Bowen decided to name the town Westwood after Westwood House, the home of Sir John Pakington, the Secretary of State for the Colonies and War in 1852.[2][6]\r\nWestwood is a town in the Rockhampton Region and a locality split between the Rockhampton Region and the Shire of Banana in Queensland, Australia.[2][3][4] It was the first town gazetted by the Queensland Government. In the 2011 census, Westwood had a population of 220 people.[1]\r\nWestwood State School is a government co-educational primary school (P-6) in Herbert Street. In 2014, the school had an enrolment of 9 children with 2 teachers (1 full-time equivalent).[15]\r\nWestwood is 50 kilometres (31 mi) south west of the city of Rockhampton. The Capricorn Highway passes through the town, and the intersection with the Leichhardt Highway is a few kilometres to the southwest. The town of Westwood consists of a handful of houses, a hotel, and a police station.The major industry of the area is cattle grazing. The northern half of the locality of Westwood is in Rockhampton Region while the southern part is in the Shire of Banana.[5]\r\nWestwood State School opened on 26 August 1872.[8][9]\r\nIn 1867, the Great Northern Railway (now known as the Central Western Line) reached the area from Rockhampton, and Westwood became the railhead.[7] The first load of wool was railed from the town on 23 August.\r\nThe town was meant to be the railhead for only a short time; however, bureaucracy and financial difficulties for the state meant that the next section of the line did not commence construction until 1873. The significance of Westwood declined when the railhead moved further west.\r\nIn 1919 a 64-bed sanitorium was opened in Westwood to treat miner\'s phthisis, a lung disease suffered by miners from working in dusty conditions. Later it treated patients with tuberculous. In 1953, a ¾ mile bitumen road was built from the Huxham railway siding (just to the north of Westwood) to the sanitorium and named Haigh Drive in memory of Leonard Garfield Haigh, the former chairman of the Rockhampton Hospitals Board from 2 June 1933 to 16 February 1953. Commencing with a tiled-roof waiting shed at the siding with a plaque commemorating Haigh, the drive to the sanitorium was flanked with peltophorum trees and was officially opened by James Larcombe (MLA for Rockhampton) in the presence of Haigh\'s widow on Sunday 1 November 1953.[10][11] More effective medical treatments for tuberculous resulted in the closure of the sanitorium in 1959, but the building continued to be used as a nursing home until the 1980s. The sanitorium buildings were then relocated or demolished; one is in use as a private home in Emerald.[12]',0,-23.619461,150.159688),(10368,'Willows','4702','Central Highlands (Qld)','Central

They compete against different schools in the area such as Clarke Creek State School, Milman State School and School of Distance Education. They compete in swimming and athletic carnivals which they normally host, having a 16-metre pool and a grassy oval.

It overlooks the islands of Keppel Bay, including the Great Keppel Island. Emu Park is a popular tourist spot, and has won several tourism awards, and features fishing, surfing, boating, and unspoiled beaches.\r\nEmu Park has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:\r\nEmu Park\'s European history dates to the 1860s when the Jardine family established a cattle grazing property south of the current town, at Zilzie, an anagram of Lizzie Jardine.[4]\r\nIn 2014, it was announced that Emu Park would be permitted to enter team into Rockhampton Senior Rugby League\'s A-grade, reserve and Under 20\'s competitions for the 2015 season. Home games will be initially be played at Bicentennial Oval in Emu Park before moving to the football fields at the new sports facility once it is built.\r\nHewittville Post Office opened on 12 November 1883 (a receiving office had been open from 1876) and was renamed Emu Park in 1890.[6] By the 1920s the town boasted two large hotels, a cinema, court house, state primary school, public library, shops and many guest houses for visitors. A small pier was opened by Mrs Bruce, wife of the Prime Minister, Stanley Bruce, in 1926 and Bell Park, a shady park on the shores of Fisherman\'s Beach was established in the 1930s.[7]\r\nEmu Park hosts a variety of annual community events including the Festival of the Wind kite festival,[9] the Classics By The Coast vintage car show and Emu Park Lions Club Oktoberfest (now running over 30 years) celebrations.[10] The town\'s popular market days are held on the third Sunday of each month in Bell Park.[11]\r\nEmu Park township was established in the 1870s when several Rockhampton families built seaside holiday houses on the hills overlooking the two beaches that are a feature of the town - Fisherman\'s Beach and Pine Beach. Emu Park was connected to Rockhampton by train in 1888 and became a popular, but fairly select, seaside resort from that time on. A branch to Yeppoon, further to the north was opened in 1910.[5]\r\nThe railway link from Rockhampton closed in the 1960s due to declining passenger numbers and the line to Yeppoon no longer exists.[5]Remnants of the Woppaburra people evicted from their homeland in the Greater and South Keppel islands lived on in both Emu Park and Yeppoon.[8]',0,-23.257223,150.826350),(10417,'Zilzie','4710','Rockhampton','Central Queensland','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-23.287293,150.800689),(10418,'Glendale','4711','Rockhampton','Central Queensland','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-23.252534,150.476229),(10419,'Glenlee','4711','Rockhampton','Central Queensland','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-23.275910,150.508009),(10421,'Woorabinda','4713','Central Highlands (Qld)','Central Queensland','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-24.114138,149.430965),(10422,'Baree','4714','Rockhampton','Central Queensland','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-23.624671,150.391364),(10423,'Boulder Creek','4714','Rockhampton','Central Queensland','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-23.695791,150.337835),(10424,'Fletcher Creek','4714','Rockhampton','Central Queensland','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-23.758481,150.371165),(10425,'Hamilton Creek','4714','Rockhampton','Central Queensland','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-23.671451,150.398565),(10426,'Horse Creek','4714','Rockhampton','Central Queensland','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-23.663059,150.382617),(10427,'Johnsons Hill','4714','Rockhampton','Central Queensland','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-23.617817,150.415623),(10428,'Leydens Hill','4714','Rockhampton','Central Queensland','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-23.611182,150.413184),(10429,'Limestone','4714','Rockhampton','Central Queensland','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-23.637281,150.443544),(10430,'Moongan','4714','Rockhampton','Central Queensland','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-23.606382,150.400845),(10432,'Nine Mile Creek','4714','Rockhampton','Central Queensland','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-23.702201,150.402544),(10433,'Oakey Creek','4714','Rockhampton','Central Queensland','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-23.750527,150.360975),(10434,'Struck Oil','4714','Rockhampton','Central Queensland','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-23.614052,150.448475),(10435,'The Mine','4714','Rockhampton','Central Queensland','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-23.629591,150.374705),(10436,'Trotter Creek','4714','Rockhampton','Central Queensland','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-23.685291,150.358856),(10437,'Walmul','4714','Rockhampton','Central Queensland','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-23.721451,150.371835),(10438,'Walterhall','4714','Rockhampton','Central Queensland','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-23.630586,150.384082),(10439,'Wura','4714','Rockhampton','Central Queensland','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-23.810627,150.325976),(10440,'Biloela','4715','Biloela','Central Queensland','QLD','Various sporting organisations are active within the community, such as Panthers Rugby League Club, Biloela Rugby Union Club, Biloela Touch Football Association, Callide Valley Tennis Association, Biloela Netball Association, Biloela Golf Club, Biloela Cricket Association, Biloela Valley\'s Football Club (soccer), Biloela Swimming Club, Biloela Dirt Rider Club and the Biloela Police Citizens Youth Club.\r\nThe Callide Dam was constructed in 1965 to supply water for a nearby power station in Biloela in the state of Queensland, Australia. Callide Dam holds 136,300 megalitres (3.60×1010 US gal) at an average depth of 10.5 metres (34 ft) and a surface area of 1,240 hectares (3,100 acres) at full capacity.

Cotton, sorghum and wheat are grown in the area. The Callide Power Stations lie just north of the town. Coal was discovered on Callide Creek in 1891[16] and is now mined at the nearby Callide[17] and Boundary Hill mines which supply the power station. The third largest abattoir in Queensland is situated in the town.[18]\r\nBiloela holds an annual Rockfest (music festival) in March.[21]\r\nBiloela (/bɪləˈwiːlə/ bil-ə-WEE-lə)[2] is a rural town and locality in Shire of Banana, Central Queensland, Australia.[3][4] It is situated 120 kilometres (75 mi) inland from the port city of Gladstone at the junction of the Burnett and Dawson highways. At the 2011 census, Biloela had a population of 5,808.[1] Biloela is the administrative centre of Banana Shire, which has an area of 15,729 square kilometres (6,073 sq mi).\r\nThe first open-cut mine was established in 1942.\r\nIn April, Rotary holds its annual Ute muster.[21]\r\nGladstone-based AM radio station 4CC services the Biloela area via a local transmitter which broadcasts on a separate frequency to the main Gladstone transmitter. This enables 4CC to play separate commercial breaks in the Bilolea region, to attract Biloela businesses to buy advertising, to target people in the local area as opposed to the entire Central Queensland region. [24]\r\nBiloela\'s local newspaper is the Central Telegraph which is issued weekly. The newspaper is part of APN\'s Australian Regional Media (ARM) network of newspapers. [23]\r\nBiloela has two primary schools: St Joseph\'s Catholic Primary (private), and Biloela State School. It has a private school college, Redeemer Lutheran College, and it has one state high school (Biloela State High School).\r\nAlso in March, the Callide Dam also plays host to the annual Callide Dam Fishing Competition in which a number of introduced stock are caught.[21]\r\nThe name Biloela is generally believed to be the Aboriginal word (possibly from the Sydney area) for black or white cockatoo.[3][4] The Government dockyards in Sydney were known as Biloela during 1870–1913 in an endeavour to remove the perceived stigma of the prior Cockatoo Island convict establishment.[5][6][7]\r\nThe closest fresh water depository is the Callide Dam, however it is often well below capacity due to low rainfall in the area. Despite this, the dam acts as a popular site for water skiing, camping, swimming and fishing. In particular, the dam is a haven for Eel-tailed catfish, Yellowbelly, Saratoga and Barramundi. The largest ever Barramundi recorded was at the 2008 Callide Dam fishing competition, measuring 138 centimetres (54 in).\r\nBiloela receives all free-to-air television services but is part of the Central Queensland television market, therefore receives the Rockhampton-based television stations and their associated local news bulletins and commercial breaks.\r\nRebel Media Group stations Rebel FM 88.9 (MHz)[25] and The Breeze 89.7 (MHz)[26] also broadcast to Biloela and other centres in the Banana Shire, although neither station has any local programming as all their programs originate from studios in South East Queensland. Rebel FM has a new rock & classic rock music format while The Breeze offers an easy adult contemporary & classics hits format. Both stations are part of the Rebel Media group.\r\nThe Biloela State High School opened on 29 January 1963.[11]\r\nNovember has a number of annual events: the Arts and Crafts Day, the Brigalow Arts Festival and the Biloela Festival.[21]\r\nThe town was gazetted in 1924; it was on the Rannes-Monto railway line.[8] Land sales were held in Rannes in December 1924.[9]\r\nCallide is an open-cut mining operation providing low sulphur, sub-bituminous thermal coal primarily for Queensland\'s domestic power generation.\r\nThe Callide Valley Show including the Callide Valley Ball and the Rodeo are held each May.[21]\r\nThe Callide Daw',0,-24.401296,150.511308),(10441,'Callide','4715','Biloela','Central Queensland','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-24.270966,150.499863),(10442,'Castle Creek','4715','Biloela','Central Queensland','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-24.753965,150.293878),(10443,'Dakenba','4715','Biloela','Central Queensland','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-24.352756,150.499503),(10444,'Dumgree','4715','Biloela','Central Queensland','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-24.164965,150.649496),(10445,'Greycliffe','4715','Biloela','Central Queensland','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-24.227157,150.326116),(10446,'Mount Murchison','4715','Biloela','Central Queensland','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-24.301182,150.567700),(10447,'Orange Creek','4715','Biloela','Central Queensland','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-24.358225,150.321296),(10448,'Prospect','4715','Biloela','Central Queensland','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-24.416316,150.436144),(10449,'Tarramba','4715','Biloela','Central Queensland','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-24.638465,150.270171),(10450,'Valentine Plains','4715','Biloela','Central Queensland','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-24.419597,150.580522),(10451,'Lawgi Dawes','4716','Biloela','Central Queensland','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-24.579542,150.668297),(10452,'Thangool','4716','Biloela','Central Queensland','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-24.486789,150.575739),(10454,'Bauhinia','4718','Central Highlands (Qld)','Central Queensland','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-24.568117,149.297694),(10455,'Dromedary','4718','Central Highlands (Qld)','Central Queensland','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-24.601362,149.207640),(10456,'Kianga','4718','Central Highlands (Qld)','Central Queensland','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-24.693560,150.010015),(10457,'Moura','4718','Central Highlands (Qld)','Central Queensland','QLD','Average yearly Rainfall: 732mm, raining an average of 63 days per year.

The name of the local coal mine changes each time it\'s sold - currently Dawson Mine - owned and operated by Anglo Coal. Only open-cut mining has been used since 1994. Beef, cotton and cereals are other major industries of the area.\r\nIn 1854 Charles Marshall named his leased pastoral selection Moura. There are two theories regarding the origin of the name. One is that it is named after Moura in Portugal where he served in the British Army during the Peninsular Wars.[4] The other is that it is an Aboriginal word meaning native camp dog.[2][3]\r\nThe Moura property was developed into a homestead in 1880 by Edward Homer. The town was first established in 1936 as a farming centre near the existing Moura Station.\r\nMedia related to Moura, Queensland at Wikimedia Commons\r\nThe Moura Post Office opened in late 1939.[5][6][7]\r\nCoal and Country festival held every year in the third week of August every year for seven days. The festival holds events like coal shovelling and a professional rodeo.[20][22]\r\nThe town also has many shops, including banks, post office, video store, grocery store, newsagent, beauticians, hairdressers, butcher, service station, electrical, furniture and hardware store and many more. Moura also has numerous sporting clubs (golf, bowls, squash, football) as well as eateries and restaurants. There is also a RSL and Memorial (now closed) club for socialising.\r\nMoura is a small town and locality in the Shire of Banana in Central Queensland, Australia.[2][3] It services the surrounding coal mining and rural activities. It is situated approximately 65 kilometres (40 mi) west of Biloela on the Dawson Highway, 186 kilometres (116 mi) west of the port city of Gladstone, and 171 kilometres (106 mi) south west of Rockhampton. At the 2011census, Moura had a population of 1,899 people.[1]\r\nThe APEX park is situated next to the Dawson River which is located 7 kilometres (4.3 mi) west on the Dawson highway. The APEX park has free camping grounds with facilities such as hot showers, a traditional wood barbecue, toilets and lawn for the afternoon picnic. It also has a public boat ramp.\r\nMoura Provisional School was opened on 10 September 1940.[8] It became Moura State School on 1 January 1948.[9] In 1965 a secondary department was attached to the school. By 1975, there were sufficient secondary students to warrant a formal high school and so Moura State High School was opened on 25 January 1976 with 263 pupils.[8][10]\r\nThe 150th meridian east, located just outside Moura, is a very popular among tourists as well as local residents to have their picture taken in the exact path of the longitude line. Rocks with drill holes have been lined up to represent the exact angle and location of longitude line.\r\nThere have been three mining disasters that have occurred near Moura:\r\nMoura hosts an annual campdraft in July.[22]\r\nThe Moura Museum and Information Centre is located at 33 Gillespie Street. The museum presents Moura\'s agricultural and industrial history. A set of Japanese collectables provided by the Misui Mining Company are on display.[19][20]\r\nThe Banana Shire Council has an administrative office in Gillespie Street.[23]\r\nMoura Muddy water classic is a fishing competition held annually on the 3rd weekend in February at the APEX park on the Dawson River. It brings many people from the surrounding areas for the local fishing competition.[21][22]\r\nAfter 1994, underground mining ceased and the area was operated as an open-cut coal mine.\r\nMoura State School is a government primary school (P-6), while Moura State High School is a government secondary school (7-12).

The sapphire fields located here are the largest in the southern hemisphere.[14]\r\nThe Central Queensland News is the local Emerald newspaper which is issued each Wednesday and Friday. The newspaper focuses on local news and sport directly relevant to Emerald and the Central Highlands.\r\nFairbairn Dam overflowed for the first time in 17 years on 19 January 2008.[9] Major flooding in Emerald occurred a few days after as the Nogoa River broke its banks. The floods resulted in 1,000 houses being affected and more than 2,500 people being evacuated. The 2008 floods did not reach the heights of flooding in previous years.[citation needed]\r\nSome of the recorded floods have occurred in the region in 1863, 1864, 1868, 1870, 1871, 1872, 1875, 1876, 1878, 1882, 1887, 1890, 1894, 1896, 1898, 1906, 1912, 1918, 1920s, 1950 (where 1103.77 mm rain was recorded in Queensand), 1956 was the wettest year on record with 1032.29 mm rainfall. The 1970s also had similar rainfall to the 1860s and 1870s.\r\nPrevious to the 1990s, flood damage to residential properties was almost non-existent.[citation needed] The biggest impact from flooding of the Nogoa River in Emerald itself was that one side of Emerald was cut off from the other and caravans at the Carinya Caravan Park would be towed to higher ground each time the Nogoa River rose, to prevent the caravans from being completely submerged. This caravan park is now the site of the Centro Property where Coles Supermarket and other businesses trade from. The swamp area is now part of Kidd Street, a housing development, in which an old river course ran into. The creek that ran along the back of the hospital, past the rear of Woolworths and past the Information Centre has been filled in turned into a channel with a section cemented on one side near the information centre, reducing the channel in size by approx two-thirds. This area has been allowed to be developed. This creek was renamed Creek Street for a short section.[10]\r\nEmerald receives all available ABC and commercial television stations from Rockhampton, and therefore local news bulletins Seven Local News and WIN News are broadcast to Emerald, with the bulletins occasionally featuring local news from the Central Highlands region.\r\nEmerald has nine schools: six primary schools and three secondary schools. There are three public primary schools, Denison State School, Emerald North State School and Emerald State School. Marist College Emerald, St Patrick\'s, St Brigid\'s and Emerald Christian College (ECC) are private schools. The only public high school in Emerald is Emerald State High School. The small community of Gindie exists approximately 23 kilometres (14 mi) south of Emerald on the Gregory Highway. It is also home to a primary school established in 1897, Gindie State School.\r\nEmerald has a humid subtropical climate with warm to hot summers and mild, dry winters. Maximum temperatures range from 34 °C in January to 22 °C in July, while minimums range from 22 °C to 7 °C. The average annual rainfall is 641.2 mm. The wettest year on record was 1407.2 mm in 1956. Extremes of temperature have ranged from 49.9 °C to −5.6 °C, while the wettest 24 hours on record was 182.0 mm on 25 February 1975.[13]\r\nEmerald lies on the Nogoa River, a tributary of the Fitzroy River.[4] The town lies almost 300 kilometres (190 mi) from the coast and approximately 270 kilometres (170 mi) west of the city of Rockhampton on the junction of the Capricorn and Gregory highways. The Tropic of Capricorn intersects the Gregory Highway just north of Emerald.\r\nThe Fairbairn Dam, a short drive to the south of the town, was opened in 1972, and holds back the waters of Lake Maraboon.[4] The lake covers an area of up to 150 km², making it one of the largest artificial lakes in the country. When full, it holds more water than Sydney Harbour. This extensive water supply has allowed the cotton industry to flourish in the area, and the lake is a boon for local water sports.[citation needed]\r\nEmerald is also served by local community radio station, 4EEE.\r\nEmerald is a town in the Central Highlands Region, Queensland, Australia.[3] At June 2015 Emerald had an estimated urban population of 15,225.[1] The town is the business centre for the Central Highlands Regional Council.\r\nEmerald is served by ABC Capricornia, the region\'s ABC Local Radio station. ABC Capricornia is broadcast on a local frequency, but no programming originates from Emerald as the station\'s local breakfast and morning programs are relayed to the Emerald transmitter from Rockhampton.\r\nThe citrus industry was severely affected by a citrus canker outbreak that started in 2004 and was declared over in early',0,-23.526850,148.161076),(10470,'Yamala','4720','Central Highlands (Qld)','Central Queensland','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-23.578317,148.370126),(10471,'Argyll','4721','Central Highlands (Qld)','Central Queensland','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-23.277321,147.562498),(10473,'Frankfield','4721','Central Highlands (Qld)','Central Queensland','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-22.274163,147.090849),(10474,'Gemini Mountains','4721','Central Highlands (Qld)','Central Queensland','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-22.476528,147.917892),(10475,'Kilcummin','4721','Central Highlands (Qld)','Central Queensland','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-22.371603,147.560380),(10476,'Pasha','4721','Central Highlands (Qld)','Central Queensland','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-21.729344,147.553072),(10477,'Theresa Creek','4721','Central Highlands (Qld)','Central Queensland','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-23.011862,147.610365),(10478,'Wolfang','4721','Central Highlands (Qld)','Central Queensland','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-22.564761,147.815559),(10479,'Buckland','4722','Central Highlands (Qld)','Central Queensland','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-24.506491,147.416510),(10480,'Cairdbeign','4722','Central Highlands (Qld)','Central Queensland','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-24.249511,148.051143),(10481,'Cona Creek','4722','Central Highlands (Qld)','Central Queensland','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-24.150241,147.881012),(10482,'Nandowrie','4722','Central Highlands (Qld)','Central Queensland','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-24.245495,147.611213),(10483,'Orion','4722','Central Highlands (Qld)','Central Queensland','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-24.221292,148.358726),(10485,'Wealwandangie','4722','Central Highlands (Qld)','Central Queensland','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-24.415509,148.049236),(10486,'Belcong','4723','Central Highlands (Qld)','Central Queensland','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-23.010007,148.231917),(10487,'Capella','4723','Central Highlands (Qld)','Central Queensland','QLD','It was founded in the late 1860s by graziers influenced by the good reports of Ludwig Leichhardt.\r\nCapella has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:\r\nCapella is a small town in the Central Highlands Region, Queensland, Australia.

Cassowary Coast','Cairns','QLD','Greenvale is a nickel mining settlement in Queensland, Australia, approximately 220 kilometres (137 mi) northwest of Townsville. Other metal ores are also extracted there. It is located within the Charters Towers Region.\r\nGreenvale\'s population is approximately 150; however, when the nickel mine was in operation, its population was roughly estimated to be 3,000. The 2006 Census Data states that 255 people were living in the Greenvale statistical division of the Dalrymple shire.[1]\r\nThere are no real sights at Greenvale; the nearest site of interest would be Undara Volcanic National Park approximately 130 kilometres (81 mi) to the north, however the town is a snapshot of life in 1973 so it\'s a point of interest for many passing tourists.\r\nThere is a 9-hole golf course, caravan park and general store/mini supermarket. The hotel serves meals and has a number of self-contained units once used by the mine to house staff and contractors.\r\nScandium oxide is a critical component of solid oxide fuel cells which have promise for the efficient direct production of electricity from low carbon gas fuels.\r\nThe Greenvale mining lease has undergone extensive exploration work by Straits Resources and Metallica Minerals for the purpose of reopening the nickel and cobalt operations. The surrounding areas have extensive nickel and cobalt mineralisation. During this most recent exploration work, the Lucknow ridge south of the mine has been found to contain one of the largest known reserves of scandium oxide in the Lateritic nickel ore deposits. According to the managing director of Metallica Minerals, Andrew Gillies, the deposit\'s quality and purity are remarkably high.[3][4]\r\nIt lies on the banks of the Burdekin River and on the Gregory Developmental Road. A good sealed road crosses the hills over to Townsville. An ore-carrying railway line ran between Greenvale and Queensland Nickel Industries (QNI) processing plant at Yabulu, approximately 20 kilometres (12 mi) north of Townsville from 1974 to 1993. Greenvale Post Office opened on 1 November 1973.[2] Some of the longest trains in Australia were pulled along this. The railway line tracks were removed in mid-2000; however the bridges, cuttings, blue metal and easement remain. Occasionally people walk from Yabulu to Greenvale along it, as a form of fundraising. Despite the fact that the mine itself has since concluded operations, more mining operations around the area have since commenced and homes are all fully occupied with workers supporting the regional mining and exploration.\r\nThe Three Rivers Hotel, made famous by Slim Dusty in a song by the same name, is now located at Greenvale. This is not the actual hotel where the song was penned by Stan Coster. The hotel reference is actually to the \"Mess Hall\"\"\"\" at the construction camp where Stan Coster penned the song. Stan worked as Grader operator for Thiess Brothers on the construction of the railway line. The origin of the name \"\"\"\"Three Rivers Hotel\"\"\"\" is not because the \"\"\"\"hotel\"\"\"\" was ever at the junction of the three rivers - Burdekin\"',0,-18.974523,145.118786),(10823,'Hidden Valley','4816','Innisfail -

The Council and community groups have discussed putting in place a range of initiatives so that Hughenden’s future is positive. Hughenden has taken advantage of being at the crossroads of two major highways. Land sales in Hughenden Industrial Estate have shown high growth with Stage 1 all sold and stage 2 and 3 being rushed through the Council so the next development can start. With the Industrial Estate growing, residential growth will also grow, making Hughenden well placed for growth.[9]\r\nHumidity is generally low except when the monsoon is active, when relatively lower temperatures accompany high humidity. The same applies to cloudiness: in the dry winter months over twenty days are completely clear.\r\nHughenden Post Office opened on 1 July 1878 (a receiving office had been open from 1874).[3]\r\nHughenden has a dry, tropical climate. Record temperatures have varied from around 44 °C (111 °F) in the summer months to as low as −2 °C (28 °F) in winter, but average maximum temperatures are usually a very hot 36 °C (97 °F) in summer and a very warm 25 °C (77 °F) in June and July. Minima range from 22 °C (72 °F) in summer to around 10 °C (50 °F) in winter. On average, a minimum below 2 °C (36 °F) is recorded once per year.\r\nThe Flinders Shire covers an area of 41,632 square kilometres (16,074 sq mi). The population of the Flinders Shire from the 1996 Census was 2,222. yet according to the 2001 Census the Shire population was 2,152 and in 2006 it is 1,356. Urban Hughenden\'s estimated population as of June 2006 is 1,154.[8]\r\nHughenden is served by five radio stations.\r\nApart from agricultural business, Hughenden also boasts a replica of the Muttaburrasaurus, a dinosaur, whose bones were discovered in 1963 near Muttaburra (220 km by road from Hughenden)and some teeth and other bones were also discovered around Hughenden. One reason for fossils being discovered must be the dry climate, which means the rocks are usually bare of vegetation. The town is home to the Hughenden Dinosaur Festival, which attracts tourists and includes entertainment and other events.[11] Other annual events include the Hughenden Show, held the first weekend in June; the Hughenden Country Music Festival, held every Easter week end and the Bullride and Race Day which is held in September. The Matron\'s Ball is also a popular annual event. In August 2008, Hughenden hosted the first Arid Lands Festival and The Great Hughenden Camel Endurance Challenge.[12]\r\nHughenden is located on the Flinders Highway, 376 kilometres (234 mi) west of Townsville and 1,400 kilometres (870 mi) north-west of Brisbane, the state capital. The region around Hughenden is a major centre for the grazing of sheep and cattle. The main feed is annual grasses known as Flinders grass, which grow rapidly on the (by Australian standards) fertile grey or brown cracking clay soils after rain between November and March. However, because the rainfall is extremely erratic — at Hughenden itself it has ranged from 126 millimetres (5 in) in 1926 to 1,051 millimetres (41 in) in 1950 — droughts and floods are normal and stock number fluctuate greatly.\r\nThe runoff from the Flinders River is much too erratic to provide a sustainable supply for any crop-growing via irrigation.\r\nHughenden /ˈhjuːəndən/[2] is a town in Queensland, Australia situated on the banks of the Flinders River. It was named after Hughenden Manor, the home of former British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli. At the 2011 census, Hughenden had a population of 1,151.[1]\r\nHughenden has a large range of sports on offer, including pony clubs, swimming, lawn bowls, golf, netball, tennis, campdrafting, rugby league, and gymnastics.[10]\r\nTorrens Creek near Hughenden is where the Americans stored explosives in World War II. The Americans didn\'t know of the dangerous bush fires out there. After they put out a fire they went back to camp thinking that the fire was out. However, the fire took hold again without them knowing. They then heard about twelve major explosions in succession; the explosions left craters twenty feet deep. Hot shrapnel covered a wide area and started more fires. In the townships, people said that buildings shook and windows broke, and some people were convinced that an air raid had occurred. Thousands of soldiers and civilians attacked the blaze in an attempt to stop it spreading to fuel dumps, but were unable to control it. When the fire got to the explosives it was so powerful it blew the Americans out of their trucks. Many buildings and shops got burnt down from the spreading fires. However the locals were able to save the post office. A police Constable from Torrens Creek Police was awarded the King’s Medal of Bravery.[4]\r\nHughenden has a visitor information centre, library, showground, shire hall, and racecourse.\r\nThe average annual rainfall is around 490 millimetres (',0,-20.842982,144.201073),(10902,'Porcupine','4821','Outback - North','Queensland - Outback','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-20.741340,144.354420),(10903,'Stamford','4821','Outback - North','Queensland - Outback','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-21.265193,143.809430),(10904,'Tangorin','4821','Outback - North','Queensland - Outback','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-21.726606,144.202896),(10905,'Albion','4822','Far North','Queensland - Outback','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-21.509030,142.693170),(10906,'Bellfield','4822','Far North','Queensland - Outback','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-19.341988,143.111984),(10907,'Burleigh','4822','Far North','Queensland - Outback','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-20.258595,143.106303),(10908,'Cambridge','4822','Far North','Queensland - Outback','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-20.421992,142.553597),(10909,'Maxwelton','4822','Far North','Queensland - Outback','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-20.723827,142.680621),(10910,'Nonda','4822','Far North','Queensland - Outback','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-20.679251,142.466674),(10911,'Richmond','4822','Far North','Queensland - Outback','QLD','At the 2006 census, Richmond had a population of 554.[4]\r\nThe town is located on the Flinders Highway, 498 kilometres (309 mi) west of Townsville and 406 kilometres (252 mi) east of Mount Isa.\r\nRichmond is a town and locality in the Shire of Richmond in western Queensland, Australia.

It is a popular stopping point for tourists driving to the tip of Cape York - the northernmost part of the Australian mainland.\r\nGold was discovered on the Coen River in 1876. Coen came into being first as a small fort built by gold miners and prospectors in May 1877 but this first gold rush quickly came to an end, and the settlement did not recover until 1883. It became a centre for several small goldmines in the region but, in 1893, the rich Great Northern mine boomed and the town became a more substantial place.\r\nIt has an airstrip at Coen Airport (24 kilometres (15 mi) north of the town), public library, hotel/motel, guest house, two general stores and fuel outlets, hospital, post office, police station, camping grounds, primary school kindergarten, ranger base and more. There is a scheduled air service to Lockhart and Cairns four times a week.\r\nCoen is a town and locality in the Shire of Cook, Queensland, Australia.[3][4] The town of Coen is inland on the Peninsula Developmental Road, the main road on the Cape York Peninsula in far northern Queensland. In the 2011 census, Coen had a population of 416 people.[1]\r\nCoen is an ideal destination for birdwatchers: there are good accommodations and a large and varied bird fauna with representatives from rain forest, monsoon forest and coastal forests.\r\nCoen Post Office opened on 20 June 1893 (a receiving office had been open from 1888).[5]\r\nCoen has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:\r\nThe locality of Coen is on the western side of Cape York Peninsula with the Coral Sea forming its eastern boundary. Part of the northern boundary follows the Archer River, while the Coen River forms part of its western boundary. The Peninsula Developmental Road runs roughly north to south through the locality.\r\nThe Great Northern mine continued operations until 1916 and produced some 52,000 troy ounces (1,617 kg) of gold before it closed.\r\nIn 1623, Jan Carstensz, the navigator of the ship Pera of the Dutch East India Company named a river on Cape York Peninsula after Jan Pieterszoon Coen, the Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies. Today that river is known as the Archer River and the name Coen River is given to one of its tributaries.[3][4]\r\nOn 3 July 2014, Barry Port retired from the Queensland Police. He was Australia\'s last Aboriginal police tracker. In his 36 years working for the police, he has tracked criminals, missing people and stowaways.[6][7]',0,-13.936008,143.199183),(11174,'Conjuboy','4871','Cairns - North','Cairns','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-18.682516,144.740020),(11175,'Coralie','4871','Cairns -

Temperature extremes have ranged from 36.7 °C (98.1 °F) to –0.6 °C (30.9 °F). The average annual rainfall is 1,379.8 mm (54.3 in)\r\nThe town was named after John Atherton, a pioneer pastoralist who settled at Mareeba (then known as Emerald End) in 1875. The area was formerly known as Priors Pocket or Priors Creek.[2]\r\nEach year towards the end of August, Atherton celebrates the Maize festival, which features a parade with decorated floats, the Maize Queen pageant, children\'s amusement rides and activities including tug of war and wood chopping. There are also shop window displays and artwork competitions, as well as a prize given to the best float.\r\nAtherton Post Office opened by 1903 (a receiving office had been open since 1889).[4]\r\nAtherton is joined by the Gillies Highway to Yungaburra, the Kennedy Highway north to Mareeba and south to Ravenshoe and Mount Garnet, the Malanda Road to Malanda and the Herberton Road to Herberton.\r\nAtherton has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:\r\nAtherton is a town and locality on the Atherton Tablelands within the Tablelands Region, Far North Queensland, Australia.[2][3] At the 2011 census, Atherton had a population of 7,287.[1]\r\nThe land around Atherton is used to grow a variety of crops, including sugar cane, peanuts, mangoes, maize (corn), potatoes, avocados and macadamia nuts. Dairy and beef cattle are also reared in the area.\r\nAtherton has two primary schools, one secondary school, one independent Prep - Grade 12 school and a technical and further education (TAFE) campus. There are also two day care centres in the town.\r\nThe Atherton Courthouse was used as a wartime hospital for officers during World War II and has air raid bunkers beneath the building.[7]\r\nThe Atherton War Memorial commemorates local residents who died in World War I. It was dedicated on 1 May 1924 by the Tinaroo Shire chairman, Frederick Grau. It is the only war memorial in Queensland of a digger in an animated pose.[5][6]\r\nTrans North offers a number of return services during a seven-day week between Atherton, Tolga, Walkamin, Mareeba, Kuranda, and Cairns including drop-offs to airport, railway station, hospitals and bus depots. There are connections available between Ravenshoe and Herberton and along the Wheelbarrow Way to Chillagoe. There is an Atherton taxi service.\r\nThe annual Atherton Agricultural Show is held in the second week of July at Atherton Show grounds including Heritage Listed Merriland Hall. The \'Atherton Show\' is run by an army of volunteers of the (not-for-profit) Atherton Tableland Agricultural Society. Since 1904 the show brings together the values and aspirations of our community. It is a celebration of achievements ranging from the beauty of a delicate piece of embroidery to excellence in cattle breeding. There is also of course the fun of the rides and games in sideshow alley!\r\nAtherton Hospital is in the Tablelands Health District.

Lake Eacham is popular for swimming and Lake Barrine has a teahouse and gift shop as well as cruises around the lake however is unsuitable for swimming due to the cruise boats. Both lakes have walking tracks around them. Lake Barrine\'s track is 6 kilometres (3.7 mi) and Lake Eacham\'s is 3 kilometres (1.9 mi).\r\nThere are a number of places to dine, from Takeaway to fine dining.\r\nIn the early 1880s the area around Allumbah Pocket was used as an overnight stop for miners travelling west from the coast. In 1886 the land was surveyed, and in 1891 settlers moved in.\r\nAllumbah Pocket is a picnic area on Petersons Creek which runs past Yungaburra. It is the centre for a series of walking tracks along the creek. Tracks lead to Frawley\'s Pool, a popular swimming hole and picnic area, then further to Yungaburra\'s historical train bridge. In the opposite direction there is a track to the platypus viewing deck. Aside from this all of the tracks are relatively easy and short enough for anyone to do. The site is dedicated to Geoff Tracy, a local renowned environmentalist who died in 2004.\r\nPrior to European settlement the area around Yungaburra was inhabited by about sixteen different indigenous groups, with the custodians being Yidinji people and neighbouring Ngajanji people. [3]\r\nYungaburra\'s economy today revolves around tourism, and the town contains a primary school, post office, library/telecentre and a range of businesses and services for the use of residents and visitors. Other facilities include a tennis court and a bowling club.The town has 18 Heritage Listed buildings, and is the largest National Trust village in Queensland. The Yungaburra Markets, held on the fourth Saturday of each month, are one of the largest in Far North Queensland, and each year around the end of October, Yungaburra holds the two-day Yungaburra Folk Festival, featuring concerts from Australian (and sometimes international) folk musicians. Yungaburra is also the site of the war memorial to soldiers lost, opened 22 June 2013. The population of Yungaburra is 1,034 persons as of 30 June 2009. There is a network of walking tracks around the town including Peterson\'s Creek.\r\nLake Eacham Hotel\r\nIn 2006, The Atherton Tableland region was damaged by the Category 4 (on the Australian scale) Cyclone Larry. Of the 19 heritage listed sites in Yungaburra, only the roofs of the community hall, police station and one of the bush cottages were badly damaged, as were the front of the Yungaburra Butchery and Gem Gallery sign. The town was restored very quickly; little evidence of the cyclone is visible.\r\nCurtain Fig Tree\r\nYungaburra is a town located on the Atherton Tableland in Far North Queensland, Australia, not far from Cairns. In the 2011 census, Yungaburra had a population of 1,116 people.[1]\r\nIn 1910 the railway arrived, and the town was renamed Yungaburra, to avoid confusion with another town called Allumbah.\r\nThe landscape around Yungaburra has been shaped by millennia of volcanic activity. The most recent eruptions were approximately 10,000 years ago. Notable geological features nearby include:\r\nBy 1911 indigenous numbers had fallen to 20% of the pre-settlement population due to disease, conflict with settlers and loss of habitat.\r\nYungaburra has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:\r\nThe Curtain Fig Tree, which is just out of Yungaburra, is a giant rainforest fig tree with roots hanging down, giving it the appearance of curtains. There is a short boardwalk around the tree.\r\nThe name Yungaburra comes from Janggaburra, after janggaburru, the Yindiny word for the Queensland silver ash (Flindersia bourjotiana).[4]\r\nAt the 2006 census, Yungaburra had a population of 932.[5]\r\nYungaburra has access to the southern arm of Lake Tinaroo which is popular for fishing, canoeing, sailing, swimming, water-skiing and camping. The other main places to get to Tinaroo are Kairi and the township of Tinaroo.',0,-17.270524,145.583106),(11379,'Butchers Creek','4885','Tablelands (East) - Kuranda','Cairns','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-17.363155,145.693770),(11380,'Glen Allyn','4885','Tablelands (East) - Kuranda','Cairns','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-17.384245,145.666291),(11381,'Jaggan','4885','Tablelands (East) - Kuranda','Cairns','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-17.395964,145.597665),(11382,'Kureen','4885','Tablelands (East) - Kuranda','Cairns','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-17.340459,145.568281),(11383,'Malanda','4885','Tablelands (East) - Kuranda','Cairns','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-17.351899,145.592764),(11384,'North Johnstone','4885','Tablelands (East) - Kuranda','Cairns','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-17.324356,145.665470),(11385,'Peeramon','4885','Tablelands (East) - Kuranda','Cairns','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-17.318794,145.619347),(11386,'Tarzali','4885','Tablelands (East) - Kuranda','Cairns','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-17.423736,145.603861),(11387,'Topaz','4885','Tablelands (East) - Kuranda','Cairns','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-17.430265,145.720860),(11388,'Beatrice','4886','Tablelands (East) - Kuranda','Cairns','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-17.542146,145.605722),(11389,'Ellinjaa','4886','Tablelands (East) - Kuranda','Cairns','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-17.503155,145.632382),(11390,'Maalan','4886','Tablelands (East) - Kuranda','Cairns','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-17.614955,145.602943),(11391,'Middlebrook','4886','Tablelands (East) - Kuranda','Cairns','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-17.562825,145.636352),(11392,'Millaa Millaa','4886','Tablelands (East) - Kuranda','Cairns','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-17.513293,145.613119),(11393,'Minbun','4886','Tablelands (East) - Kuranda','Cairns','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-17.474264,145.582340),(11394,'Moregatta','4886','Tablelands (East) - Kuranda','Cairns','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-17.495586,145.578412),(11395,'Mungalli','4886','Tablelands (East) - Kuranda','Cairns','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-17.546295,145.697091),(11396,'Herberton','4887','Tablelands (East) - Kuranda','Cairns','QLD','Tin mining ceased in Herberton in 1978.\r\nA Heritage Walk for tourists that takes in some of the old buildings and historical features of the town is a popular attraction. Herberton Historical Village is a 16-acre, re-creation of the town during the tin mining era, with exhibits such as vintage machinery, cars and Australian antiques. It has more than 50 restored period buildings.[15]\r\nHerberton is notably drier than the area around Atherton with average rainfall for Herberton of 1,155 mm (45.5 in).[12] Herberton is the most northerly location in Australia to have recorded a temperature at or below −5 °C (23 °F), and also the only location in Tropical North Queensland to have done so. The average minimum temperature ranges from 10 °C (50 °F) in winter to 18 °C (64 °F) in summer, while maximums range from 21 to 29 °C (70 to 84 °F).\r\nAt the 2006 census, Herberton had a population of 974.[5]\r\nAt its apogee, Herberton was the richest tin mining field in Australia, and was home to 17 pubs, 2 local newspapers and a brewery.\r\nThe Spy and Camera Museum houses antique spy cameras, a photographic gallery and photographic memorabilia with guided tours through the museum and a working photographer and photographic studio.\r\nIn the late 19th century the Mulligan Highway was carved through the hills from Herberton and passed through what is now Main Street, Atherton, before continuing down to Port Douglas. This road was used by the coaches of Cobb and Co to access Western Queensland.\r\nNotable people associated with Herberton include:\r\nHerberton has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:\r\nSeveral crops are grown around Herberton, and it is the location of Queensland\'s only tropical vineyard. Herberton is a mini salad bowl with crops including avocados, lettuce, tomatoes, maize and pumpkins . Poultry and beef industries are also present. Herberton\'s public hospital and the private school, Mt Saint Bernard residential college, are other major employers in the town.\r\nThe Herberton Mining Museum and Visitor Information Centre [14] opened in 2005, and caters to the needs of the tourism industry. There are several caravan parks, hotels, motels and B&Bs located in the town. Herberton is the oldest town on the Atherton Tablelands and is often referred to as the Village in the Hills.\r\nThe first European exploration of this area was undertaken in 1875 by James Venture Mulligan. Mulligan was prospecting for gold, but instead found tin . The town of Herberton was established on 19 April 1880 by John Newell to exploit the tin find, and mining began on 9 May. By the September of that year, Herberton had a population of 300 men and 27 women. Herberton Post Office opened on 22 November 1880.[4] In December 1881 a State School was established.\r\nMost recently, a Railway Museum has been established by volunteers in the former Herberton Railway Station building. This is operated by volunteers and only open part-time.\r\nHerberton is situated 918 m (3,012 ft) high on the Great Dividing Range south-west of Atherton. Vegetation ranges from tropical rainforest to the east, wet schlerophyl forests to the north and east and open schleorphyl forests and woodlands to the north and west.\r\nThe Tepon Equestrian Grounds [16] just out of Herberton have recently been upgraded with a large undercover pavilion for equestrian and other sporting events such as cycling and mountain biking. Local markets are held on the 3rd Sunday of every month at the Wondecla Oval.\r\nHerberton is a town and locality on the Atherton Tableland in Far North Queensland, Australia.[2][3] In the 2011 census, Herberton had a population of 934 people.[1]',0,-17.384931,145.386636),(11397,'Irvinebank','4887','Tablelands (East) - Kuranda','Cairns','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-17.428458,145.199097),(11398,'Kalunga','4887','Tablelands (East) - Kuranda','Cairns','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-17.449687,145.380865),(11399,'Moomin','4887','Tablelands (East) - Kuranda','Cairns','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-17.360237,145.406904),(11400,'Watsonville','4887','Tablelands (East) - Kuranda','Cairns','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-17.376368,145.293136),(11401,'Wondecla','4887','Tablelands (East) - Kuranda','Cairns','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-17.411073,145.392260),(11402,'Evelyn','4888','Tablelands (East) - Kuranda','Cairns','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-17.499336,145.491052),(11403,'Kaban','4888','Tablelands (East) - Kuranda','Cairns','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-17.503810,145.390013),(11404,'Millstream','4888','Tablelands (East) - Kuranda','Cairns','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-17.644817,145.344895),(11405,'Ravenshoe','4888','Tablelands (East) - Kuranda','Cairns','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-17.607980,145.483223),(11406,'Tumoulin','4888','Tablelands (East) - Kuranda','Cairns','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-17.567647,145.456494),(11407,'Howitt','4890','Outback - North','Queensland - Outback','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-17.281509,141.625841),(11408,'Norman','4890','Outback - North','Queensland - Outback','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-17.679813,141.075672),(11409,'Normanton','4890','Outback - North','Queensland - Outback','QLD','Normanton is a small cattle town and locality in the Shire of Carpentaria in Queensland, Australia.[2][3] In the 2011 census, Normanton had a population of 1,468 people of whom 696 were Indigenous Australians.[1]\r\nNormanton has a sports centre, golf course, bowling green, gun club, racecourse, rodeo ground, and an aerodrome. Normanton public library and visitor information services are located in the historic Burns Philp Building.[21]\r\nIn the early years there was a large Aboriginal population as well. Some Aboriginal people were moved to Mornington Island and Doomadgee in the early 20th century.\r\nTemperatures are uniformly hot, ranging from 36.8 °C (98 °F) in November just before the wet season begins to 29 °C (84 °F) at the height of the dry season in July. In the wet season, temperatures are marginally lower, but extremely high humidity means conditions are very uncomfortable and wet bulb temperatures averages 25 °C (77 °F) and can reach 28 °C (82 °F). In the dry season, lower humidity and extremely low cloudiness provides for rather less uncomfortable conditions.\r\nIn 2006 census, the town\'s population was 1,100, 60 per cent of whom were Indigenous Australians.[13]\r\nLike other Gulf communities the prawning industry makes an important economic contribution to the town. Tourism has recently become an important part of the economy of Normanton, with Gulflander a significant draw-card.[10]\r\nNormanton has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:\r\nThe site for the town was selected because Burketown was abandoned owing to fever and flooding.[4] Settlers moved into the town in 1867.[9] Normanton attracted people from a variety of cultures, including Chinese drawn to the gold fields.[4] The population reached 1,251 by 1891.[10] The gold boom was short-lived. By 1947 the town\'s population had declined to 234.[10] Norman River Post Office opened on 13 June 1868 and was renamed Normanton by 1872.[11]\r\nNormanton is in the Gulf Country region of northwest Queensland, just south of the Gulf of Carpentaria, on the Norman River.\r\nNormanton is the administrative centre of Shire of Carpentaria.[4] Among Normanton\'s most notable features is a statue[5] of an 8.64 m long saltwater crocodile named Krys, the largest ever taken, which was shot by Krystina Pawlowska in July 1957 in the Norman River.[6] Barramundi and Threadfin Salmon may also be caught in the river. [7] The Big Barramundi, which is 6 m long is also located in the town.[8]\r\nThe town contains the longest intact and operating Burns Philp store in Queensland. The general mercantile store and agency office was opened in 1884.[12]\r\nSix kilometres south of the town is the start of the Gulf Developmental Road, part of the Savannah Way tourist drive. The Normanton railway station features a large steel frame with an open canopy to provide shade.[9]\r\nNormanton has a tropical savanna climate with two distinct seasons. There is a hot, humid and extremely uncomfortable wet season from December to March and a hot and generally rainless dry season usually extending from April to November. During the wet season most roads in the area are usually closed by heavy rainfall, which on several occasions has exceeded 650 millimetres (26 in) in a month or 250 millimetres (10 in) in a day from tropical cyclones. On occasions, as with all of Queensland, the wet season may fail and deliver as little as 240 millimetres (9.4 in) between December 1934 and March 1935[22]\r\nThe town is one terminus of the isolated Normanton to Croydon railway line, which was built during gold rush days in the 1890s. The Gulflander motor train operates once a week.',0,-17.669996,141.079184),(11410,'Karumba','4891','Outback - North','Queensland - Outback','QLD','Not yet populated',0,-17.483843,140.839772),(11411,'Bloomfield','4895','Port Douglas -

Port Wakefield Road, the main highway taking traffic to the north of Adelaide, passes through the area and used to pass straight through Virginia. Market gardening is the main activity there.\r\nFrom 1969 to 1974, Virginia was home to the Thunderbird Raceway, a dirt track speedway located at the towns Recreation Reserve (now the local Australian rules football and cricket oval). Originally known as the Virginia Fairgrounds Speedway when it opened in 1969 (work had begun in 1968), the name was changed to Thunderbird Raceway in 1971 under the promotion of Doug Sunstrom who had taken over from the original promoters, the Bevan family. Sunstrom promoted the speedway as a ½ mile track, though it was closer to ⅓ mile (500 metres (550 yd)) in length.

The town is home also to a small café, known as the Maccy Melting Pot. Adjacent is the Macclesfield Lucky Seven store.\r\nGeorge Davenport was an English banker who was a director of the South Australian Company in England and together with partners Frederick Luck (quarter share) and Roger Cunliffe (1/8 share) paid £4416 for a special survey of 4416 acres (1619 ha) in South Australia. He sent his eldest son (George) Francis to select the land, arriving in Adelaide in February 1840. After initially considering land near Port Lincoln, Francis selected land on the upper reaches of the River Angas, including what is now the town of Macclesfield. This was the last of the special surveys in the area. The town of Macclesfield was named after the Earl of Macclesfield, to whom George Davenport was a steward in England. Francis Davenport returned to England in 1841, leaving Henry Giles to manage his affairs.[4]\r\nMacclesfield is 14 km south of Mount Barker in the Adelaide Hills. On Sunday 13 October 2013 the community held an opening event for Crystal Lake Park to celebrate the return of community access to the park and the unveiling of the Yoshin Ogata sculpture. Crystal Lake Park, site of the historic swimming pool, is now a community multipurpose arts and recreation park and part of the Hills Sculpture Trail.\r\nMacclesfield is a small town on the upper reaches of the River Angas in the Adelaide Hills region of South Australia. In the 2006 census, Macclesfield had a population of 1238[1]\r\nMacclesfield is serviced by a volunteer Country Fire Service who assisted in warding off the Ash Wednesday Bushfires in February 1983.\r\nFrancis and his wife Sarah returned in February 1843 along with Samuel, his wife Margaret (married 1 June 1842) and their other brother Robert. Francis died on 8 April 1843 (probably of typhus); later Samuel and Margaret moved to Beaumont and Robert lived at Battunga near Macclesfield and managed the survey.\r\nChristmas Carols are another event. Acts include performances by a community group called Young At Heart, students of the local Macclesfield Primary School choir and various others. Also various readings are given during the night\'s proceedings shared between the Catholic, Uniting and Anglican churches. The carols are printed on a program and wax or electric candles available for purchase from a stall near the rotunda.\r\nThe annual Macclesfield Strawberry Fete, which evolved from the \'All British Fair\' which was first held in 1927 as a St John’s Church of England fundraiser, is held on the last Sunday of November at the town\'s Davenport Square. Ever since, strawberries and cream have been central to a popular family celebration with stalls featuring food, crafts, and local produce.\r\nAt various times through the year the local Battunga Lions Club sell recycled goods from their shed at the Recreation Grounds and there are many other major community events held within the township.[7]\r\nThe first hotel, The Goat\'s Head Inn, was established in 1841.[5] It was later known as the Macclesfield Arms, Davenport Arms, and now Three Brothers\' Arms after the three Davenport brothers. The brewery next door to the hotel was opened by 1851, but converted to a butter and cheese factory around 1903 and abandoned in favour of a new factory in 1937.[6]\r\nMacclesfield is in the District Council of Mount Barker local government area\'s South Ward. As of 2015[update], the elected representative members in the South Ward were Roger Irvine and Greg Morrison.[3] The town is also in the state electorate of Heysen and the federal Division of Mayo.\r\nMacclesfield has been served by a primary school since 1876. In 2010, the Macclesfield Primary School celebrated 150 years of education in the town and surrounding districts. The ceremony was attended by many, including Alexander Downer MP, who lived in Macclesfield in the 1980s with his wife and children. The town is also home to the Macclesfield Football Club, Macclesfield Flames Netball Club, Macclesfield Redbacks Cricket Club, Macclesfield Basketball Club and Macclesfield Tennis Club.

The layout of the town in circa 1857 is attributed to Lewis Fidge, a local farmer. The town is reported as growing quickly with the construction of a ‘hotel, church, blacksmith’s shop and a number of other shops and trades.’ In the 1870s, the combination of declining productivity of the land and opportunities such as the availability of land in South Australia’s mid-North resulted in a population decline. However, the town survived due to its location on the Old Coach Road which continues south to towns along the east coast of Gulf St Vincent as part of what is now called the Main South Road.[7] Aldinga Post Office opened around 1851 and closed in 1992.[8]\r\nThe bands Another\'s Life, The Fall Of Troy, and I Killed The Prom Queen come from Aldinga.[citation needed]\r\nAldinga /ɔːlˈdɪŋɡə/ is a suburb of Adelaide in South Australia located about 45 kilometres (28 mi) south of the Adelaide city centre in the City of Onkaparinga.',0,-35.267326,138.483136),(11909,'Aldinga Beach','5173','Onkaparinga','Adelaide - South','SA','\r\nAldinga Beach is associated with two protected areas - the Aldinga Scrub Conservation Park and the Aldinga Reef Aquatic Reserve.

A jetty was constructed on the coast to export the wheat grown in the district. The district council was officially proclaimed in 1854 and by the late 1860s the Yankalilla and Normanville had three flour mills, five stores, two breweries, four blacksmiths, three hotels and five churches.[11]\r\nThe town experiences a Mediterranean climate, like the rest of the Peninsula; with warm to hot, dry summers and cold, wet winters.\r\nMore recently, a Kaurna scholar, Georgina Yambo Williams (co-authoring a paper with Rob Amery) has accounted for the origin of the town\'s name. Drawing from her own knowledge and various literary sources from the period of colonisation, she relates that Yankalilla comes from the words yerkandi, meaning to fall to, to join onto, much in the way a disease does, and lya and illa, which means \'place\'. Thus, we get Yankalilla, literally, the \'place of the fallen bits\'. This, of course, is in reference to the Dreaming story of Tjibruki related above; who carried his dead nephew\'s disintegrating body from (what is now called) the Sturt River to Yankalilla, where he collapsed.[8]\r\nYankalilla and its districts can be reached by driving south from Adelaide along Main South Road, or alternatively by taking the Victor Harbor Road, which increases travelling time.\r\nThe Southern Fleurieu Health Service covers the town, with no hospital in Yankalilla.[20] The Yankalilla Area school supplies the town\'s educational needs, with R-12 level teaching. A public library is also located in the town, with membership and borrowing free of charge.\r\nSince its establishment, Yankalilla has had cereal crops such as wheat and barley as a major agricultural component, and today this still remains the case. Dairy farming and livestock grazing, including sheep and cattle have also become important to the economy, with dairy products one of the towns biggest exports. Forestry has been attempted in the area and is still occurring in the district.[18]\r\nThe local news service, The Yankalilla News is a free monthly magazine focusing on the Fleurieu Peninsula, and is available throughout the region in shops and directly to post boxes, reaching more than 4500 households in the district.[22]\r\nThere are a large number of environmental groups in the district, with some based in Yankalilla. Most aim to restore the land to the original conditions, with animal conservation, river and soil monitoring groups well established.\r\nSealink buses run to Yankalilla.\r\nIn the 2001 census by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, it was found that the population of the Yankalilla was 440, with there being nearly exactly the same number of males and females (221 males: 219 females).[23]\r\nA number of events occur annually, including the Yankalilla Agricultural show, the Easter Art Show and the New Year\'s Eve Pagent notable.\r\nEvidence of Megafauna, including bones attributed to Diprotodon, Maesopus (a giant kangaroo) and Thylacoleo (a marsupial lion) were discovered in the 1890s in a swamp near Yankalilla and conjecture surrounds the possibility that the animals were hunted by the Ramindjerl people.[6]\r\nThe economy of the town is based mostly on the surrounding agricultural lands, with industry and tourism also supplementing the town\'s economy.\r\nThe area was impacted during the Delamerian Orogeny around 500 Million Years ago, forming mountain ranges, which have long since eroded away. During the Permian ice ages, many of the areas rocks were left with striation pavements, showing the direction of glacial movement, with Glacier Rock at Inman Valley, South Australia a well studied example. During the Triassic, Laterite, an iron-rich formation was deposited, and is now of economic value in road metals.[16]\r\nThere are many sporting clubs in the town, with Yankalilla having facilities for, and active teams in the local bowls, football (Yankalilla Football Club), netball, cricket, hockey and tennis leagues. There is also a golf club, gym and skate park located within the town.[21]\r\nYankalilla is an agriculturally based town situated on the Fleurieu Peninsula in South Australia, located 72 km south of the state\'s capital of Adelaide. The town is nestled in the Bungala River valley, overlooked by the southern Mount Lofty Ranges and acts as a service centre for the surrounding agricultural district.\r\nA number of buildings in the town are heritage listed, including the Anglican church, Manor Farm and The Olives. A number of previously listed buildings are no longer standing.[14]\r\nThe Yankalilla district has European history dating back to the first settlement in South Australia, with coastal areas colonised in the late 1830s. In 1938 over 5,400 acres (22 km2) of land around Yankalilla was surveyed for sheep and dairy activities, but the current location of the town came into being four years later.\r\nIn the early stages',0,-35.454907,138.335615),(11927,'Cape Jervis','5204','Fleurieu - Kangaroo Island','South Australia - South East','SA','It overlooks the coastline adjoining the following three bodies of water - Gulf St Vincent, Investigator Strait and Backstairs Passage.

In 1858, together with partners, Richard Boucher James purchased the 60,000 acre Canowie Station, where he lived until 1863, when he returned to England.

Mount Pleasant township was developed by Henry Glover, and surveyed in 1856. It comprised the land from Railway Terrace to Saleyard Road. The name was taken from that used by James Phillis, who had come from an area near Eastry in Kent. The land had reminded him of his homeland. His sister was named Pleasant, who may also have inspired the name.\r\nAt the ABS 2001 census, Mount Pleasant had a population of 529 people living in 240 dwellings.\r\nGold was found in the district in the 1860s but the deposits were small and the miners soon moved on. The town grew slowly, never being anything more than a small service centre for the surrounding region. The former police station, which dates back to the 1860s, has been largely replaced by a building with \'ER\' on it and the Old Talunga Hotel is quite charming. The main street, Melrose Street, is lined with beautiful plane trees.[2]\r\nMount Pleasant is a town situated in the Barossa Council, just north of the Adelaide Hills region of South Australia, 55 kilometres east-north-east of the state capital, Adelaide ( WikiMiniAtlas34°46′S 139°3′E﻿ / ﻿34.767°S 139.050°E﻿ / -34.767; 139.050). It is located in the Barossa Council and Mid Murray Council local government areas, and is at an altitude of 440 metres above sea level. Rainfall in the area averages 687 mm per annum.\r\nSettlers moved into the area in the late 1830s with flocks of sheep and with bags of grain. One of the early settlers, James Phillis, had arrived in Adelaide in 1839 and literally rode a horse into the Adelaide Hills looking for suitable land to farm. He settled at Mount Pleasant in 1843, planted wheat, harvested the crop, and then had to take it to Adelaide to sell. From the profits he sailed to England where he bought a flock of Romney Marsh sheep which he shipped back to the area. Over the years he became one of the district\'s most prosperous and successful farmers. This is an extract from an article written by Nancy Mavis Pike (née Phillis). Several of Mt Pleasant\'s pioneer families were to lose sons in the Great War, like William Polden who is now buried in The Lone Pine Cemetery, Gallipoli.\r\nMount Pleasant has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:\r\nIt was formerly the centre of its own municipality, the District Council of Mount Pleasant, from 1935 to 1997.\r\nA coach is operated from Tea Tree Plaza Interchange to Gumeracha and Mount Pleasant by Affordable Coachlines.[7] A private coach service also goes from Birdwood to the Barossa Valley via Mount Pleasant.[8]\r\nMount Pleasant is located 10 km north-east of Birdwood heading towards Springton, Eden Valley and Angaston.\r\nMount Pleasant was once the terminus of the Mount Pleasant railway line which branched from the Adelaide to Murray Bridge line at Balhannah.[9] The line[10] opened on 16 September 1918 and was closed on 4 March 1963, following improved road conditions via the Adelaide-Mannum Road. The former rail corridor can still be seen from a few roads, and is gradually being converted, from Balhannah towards Mount Pleasant, into a cycling, walking and horseback riding trail known as the Amy Gillett Bikeway.

The first ship (a side-wheel paddle steamer) built on the Murray River was launched at Mannum by William Randell in 1852. A shipbuilding industry continued in Mannum until into the 20th century. William Randell is memorialised by the preservation of the boiler the Paddle Wheeler; Mary Ann in the town\'s recreation park. His dry dock held the Marion, an 1897 built paddle wheeler; managed by the National Trust of Australia as a museum. The Marion left active service in 1950 and spent until 1963 as a boarding house.[5] The Marion was recomissioned in 1994 and currently operates as a daytrip and overnight cruising vessel along the Murray.\r\nRandell St, the main street of Mannum\r\nMannum\'s significance as a river port declined with the railways reaching Morgan in 1878 and Murray Bridge in 1886. The largest ship operating on the Murray is the PS Murray Princess, a passenger stern-wheel paddle boat based at Mannum offering weekly cruises. The restored historic paddle steamer PS Marion is also based at Mannum and cruises several times a year. Before restoration, it was a static display in a drydock for many years.Mannum is also a base for houseboats available for hire. Because of its position on the Murray River; in 1954 the Mannum-Adelaide pipeline was built to help provide Adelaide with a reliable water supply.\r\nOne of the two ferries at Mannum\r\nMannum apparently has the distinction of having lost more men per head of population in both World Wars than any other town in South Australia. There is a song, called Year of the Drum, written by Wendy Joseph which describes the tragic effects of the World Wars on several generations of the people of Mannum and the use of music to entice young men to war. The song references Mannum, Shearers, Riverboats and the Murray River.[6]\r\nThe town has an Australian Football team competing in the River Murray Football League; nicknamed the Roos.\r\nA number of other manufacturing industries were established in the town, and some continue; although not as large as they once were. The largest heavy manufacturing company was David Shearer (later Horwood-Bagshaw) who made farm equipment.\r\nToday, Mannum is a busy township and a popular tourist destination, particularly during the summer months. The population of Mannum and the surrounding area grows to about 10,000 when semi-residents (shack owners) and tourists are taken into consideration. The town has three hotels, a Foodland supermarket and many specialty shops.\r\nThe Mannum Rowing Club was founded in 1910.[13] The club is located on River Lane on the banks of the Murray in Mannum. The club hosts the annual Mannum Regatta and the Arnold Cup.[14]\r\nIn the summer months, particularly over the January holidays, water sports are extremely popular (mainly water skiing and wakeboarding), where both residents and tourists bring their own water craft to use on the river.\r\nThe Aboriginal inhabitants and traditional owners of the vicinity now called Mannum were the Nganguruku (Nganguruga), part of the larger Ngayawung community.[3] In 1830 the Sturt expedition passed through the area by boat. No Europeans visited again until 25 January 1838 when the expedition of Dr George Imlay and John Hill, on horseback from Adelaide, became the first to reach the Murray overland within South Australia.[4] They noted that the thriving Indigenous population were very keen fisherfolk.\r\nMedia related to Mannum, South Australia at Wikimedia Commons\r\nMannum hosts a number of other sports during the year, most notably netball in the winter months (the netball club is also nicknamed the Roos), and cricket and tennis in the summer months.

The club last won premierships in 2011/2012 back to back.[citation needed]\r\nLanghorne Creek has a wine history dating back to 1850. Traditionally a red wine growing district well known for production of outstanding Cabernet Sauvignon and Shiraz. These two red wine grape varieties constitute approximately 70% of the total vineyard plantings in the region. Over recent years, considerable experimentation has occurred and a wide range of grape varieties are now grown. The vineyards harvest from early March to late April. The town is on the banks of the Bremer River which flows into Lake Alexandrina. In winter, the river frequently floods across the vineyards, contributing to the terroir of the region.\r\nThe township has numerous places to eat: the Langhorne Creek General Store and The Bridge Hotel can be found on the main street of the town while the Angas Plains Estate, Bremerton and Lake Breeze cellar doors all offer lunch menus that go perfectly with a glass of wine. Additionally, The Winehouse is available to hire for functions and features a full kitchen. Langhorne Creek has seven cellar doors, all open seven days a week: Angas Plains Estate, Bremerton, Bleasdale, Cleggett Wines, Lake Breeze, Rusticana and The Winehouse.[citation needed]',0,-35.295648,139.033879),(12137,'Mount Observation','5255','Fleurieu - Kangaroo Island','South Australia - South East','SA','Not yet populated',0,-35.336932,138.744833),(12138,'Mulgundawa','5255','Fleurieu - Kangaroo Island','South Australia - South East','SA','Not yet populated',0,-35.306509,139.202512),(12139,'Nalpa','5255','Fleurieu - Kangaroo Island','South Australia - South East','SA','Not yet populated',0,-35.327404,139.269433),(12140,'Red Creek','5255','Fleurieu - Kangaroo Island','South Australia - South East','SA','Not yet populated',0,-35.147741,138.972429),(12141,'Salem','5255','Fleurieu - Kangaroo Island','South Australia - South East','SA','Not yet populated',0,-35.149053,139.025565),(12142,'Sandergrove','5255','Fleurieu - Kangaroo Island','South Australia - South East','SA','Not yet populated',0,-35.338200,138.869796),(12144,'Tooperang','5255','Fleurieu - Kangaroo Island','South Australia - South East','SA','Not yet populated',0,-35.373980,138.715766),(12145,'Willyaroo','5255','Fleurieu - Kangaroo Island','South Australia - South East','SA','Not yet populated',0,-35.271862,138.921612),(12146,'Woodchester','5255','Fleurieu - Kangaroo Island','South Australia - South East','SA','Not yet populated',0,-35.204180,138.964816),(12147,'Clayton','5256','Fleurieu - Kangaroo Island','South Australia - South East','SA','Not yet populated',0,-35.497238,138.928769),(12148,'Milang','5256','Fleurieu - Kangaroo Island','South Australia - South East','SA','Milang is small town situated on the shores of Lake Alexandrina, just over 20 km from Strathalbyn, South Australia.

The survey eventually provided for 700 lots in Wellington (west side of the Murray) and 300 lots in Wellington East (east side of the Murray), as well as rural sections.

Its postcode is 5259. Wellington is in the Rural City of Murray Bridge. At the 2006 census, Wellington had a population of 295.[1]\r\nBecause of its geographical similarities, the first European colonists likened the development potential of the site of Wellington to that of New Orleans. In 1839 the London-based Secondary Towns Association, represented in Adelaide by John Morphett and John Hill, authorised expenditure on the special survey a proposed town to be named Wellington, with prior consent of the Duke of Wellington himself.\r\nWellington was the original crossing of the River Murray for people, livestock, and goods travelling overland between Adelaide and Melbourne, until a bridge was built at Murray Bridge in 1879. There is still a free government ferry operating here. In 1852-53 much of the gold escorted by South Australian Police from the Victorian gold rushes crossed the Murray at Wellington. Even though the Murray has very little flow most of the time, and Lake Alexandrina is mostly only a few metres deep, the river at Wellington is about 25 metres deep. The surface is often less than one metre above sea level.\r\nThe South Australian Government has stated its intention to build a weir at or near Wellington, despite opposition from environmental groups.

Beachport is known for its 772 metres (2,533 ft) long jetty (the second longest in South Australia behind the jetty at Port Germein), and is located on the northern end of Rivoli Bay. It has a large crayfish fishing fleet. The locality of Thornlea is wholly contained within Beachport.\r\nBeachport is believed to be the location of the first casualties of World War 2 on Australian soil. On 12 July 1941, a local fisherman discovered and towed to Beachport a German sea mine either laid by the raider Pinguin or the minelayer Passat. The following day, two Able Seamen, Thomas Todd and William Danswan, part of a three-man Rendering Mines Safe (REMS) team, were killed when a wave lifted the mine and caused it to explode on the beach while they were attempting to defuse it.[3] A monument now stands in the town to honour them.\r\nFollowing the discovery and naming of Rivoli Bay in 1802 by French navigator Nicolas Baudin, a whaling station was established there in the 1830s. The whaling industry soon declined, to be followed in succeeding decades with European settlement of the hinterland by pastoralists. Whaling was then superseded by a booming wool export industry, leading to the necessity for a port. The town was named on 23 May 1878 for the then British Secretary of State for the Colonies, Michael Hicks Beach, 1st Earl St Aldwyn.[2]\r\nBeachport was officially proclaimed a port on 21 November 1878. In the same year a lighthouse was erected close by on Penguin Island and a railway to Mount Gambier was completed. A wool and grain store was built in 1879, serviced by the railway, thereby providing a facility to link the export trade by rail and sea. The railway closed in 1956.[4] The old wool and grain store has been preserved and today serves as a National Trust museum.\r\nMedia related to Beachport, South Australia at Wikimedia Commons\r\nPopular recreational fishing spots include the Salmon Hole, jetty and 10 Mile Beach.

Water supply, sewage collection and disposal are provided by South East Catchment Water Management Board.\r\nCouncil Chamber in the Civic Centre at 10 Watson Terrace, Mount Gambier is the seat of local government for the City of Mount Gambier.[44] The council was created in 1932 when the District Council of Mount Gambier West and District Council of Mount Gambier East merged to become the District Council of Mount Gambier which was later proclaimed a city on 9 December 1954. The city consists of a mayor and ten councillors, elected equally from the East and West wards once every four years by postal voting. As of November 2007[update], the Mayor of Mount Gambier council is Steve Perryman. The local government area is situated entirely within the District Council of Grant and due to the city\'s growth there have been ongoing talks of amalgamation, the most recent boundary changes taking place in 2010.[45]\r\nIn state politics, Mount Gambier is located in the Legislative Assembly district of Electoral district of Mount Gambier, which has been held since 2014 by Liberal\'s Troy Bell.\r\nSome ABC radio services can also be received from the nearby town of Naracoorte and from Western Victoria.\r\nMount Gambier has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate (Koppen: Csb). The town has warm dry summers and cool wet winters. July is the wettest month with an average of 99.6 mm falling on 22 days whilst February normally records the lowest rainfall with an average of 25 mm on an average 8 days. The highest ever temperature recorded in Mount Gambier was 44.9 °C on 2 February 2014[9] and the lowest ever temperature recorded was −3.9 °C on 20 June 1950 and 2 July 1960. Mount Gambier has only 40.5 clear days on an annual basis.[10]\r\nThere are two high schools for Year 8 to 12:\r\nMount Gambier is the second most populous city in South Australia with an estimated urban population of 28,929.[1] The city is located on the slopes of Mount Gambier (volcano) in the south east of the state, about 450 kilometres (280 mi) south-east of the capital Adelaide and just 17 kilometres (11 mi) from the Victorian border, it is the most important settlement in the Limestone Coast region and the seat of government for both the City of Mount Gambier and the District Council of Grant.\r\nThe government in the south-east area of the state, consisting of three local councils, amounted to a single administration. In consequence, many residents of Victoria used to look across the border to Mount Gambier as their centre. Consequently, during the 1970s many elderly locals relocated to Victor Harbor and Moonta, both rural areas but with more resources available to cope with an ageing population. A 1976 study found that less than 10 per cent (around 160 people) of residents aged over 65 had lived in the area for less than 5 years, leading to a lack of specific aged-care facilities.[12]\r\nLaw and order for the Limestone Coast region is maintained via the Mount Gambier Police Complex at 42 Bay Road Mount Gambier, the Mount Gambier Magistrates Court at 41 Bay Road Mount Gambier and the Mount Gambier Prison at Moorak south of the city.[46][47][48]\r\nDue to the close proximity to the Victoria/South Australia state border, most people in Mount Gambier and some adjacent areas of southeast South Australia can receive television services from Western Victoria. These channels are broadcast from the Mount Dundas transmitter near the town of Cavendish, Victoria. The transmitter site is located approximately 100 kilometres northeast of Mount Gambier and broadcasts all the television channels from Western Victoria including Prime7 Television (AMV), WIN Television Victoria (VTV), Southern Cross Ten (BCV), the ABC and SBS Victorian services, as well as the digital free-to-air multi-channels that are also now available from the Mount Burr transmitter, north west of Mount Gambier.\r\nMount Gambier\'s urban area is located mainly along the northern slopes and plain of a maar volcano of the same name, Mount Gambier. Comprising several craters, it is part of the Newer Volcanics Province complex of volcanoes. One of these contains a huge lake of high-quality artesian drinking water which changes colour with the seasons. In winter, it is a steel grey and then changes to a spectacular cobalt blue in the summer, giving rise to its name, Blue Lake. This 70-metre (230 ft) deep lake also accommodates a range of unusual aquatic flora and fauna, in particular fields of large stromatolites. There are several other craters in the city including Valley Lake and the Leg of Mutton Lake.

After a well was dug at Lameroo, then known as Wow Wow Plain, in 1884, settlement on Wow Wow Plain became permanent. The land was surveyed in 1894 and the initial survey of Wow Wow Plain gave each block some natural open land to start cultivating. The town reserve was proclaimed in 1894 and a Government well excavated.

The first Europeans to visit overland, by horseback, in March 1838, was the expedition of Hill, Oakden, Willis, and Wood.[3] They noted a large Indigenous population. The locality was originally known to Europeans as the North West Bend, or Nor\'west Bend, or Great South Bend, due to an acute change in the trend and direction of the Murray. The westward flowing stream of the river turns here to flow southward. The nearby pioneering pastoral station, Northwest Bend Station, established in the 1840s, still bears that name.\r\nMorgan has a number of heritage-listed buildings, including:\r\nMuseum\r\nDuring World War II, the Morgan-Whyalla pipeline was built from the Murray River at Morgan to supply fresh water to the city of Whyalla.\r\nMorgan today is well known for its number of houseboat moorings and services, and a houseboat marina is currently under construction. A free road transport ferry service operates 24 hours for river crossings.

A large wharf was built, and Morgan, being the railway terminus (hence the name of a local hotel), became one of the busiest ports on the Murray. It handled nearly all the goods that were being imported and exported (particularly wool) to and from a vast region upstream from Morgan along the Murray and Darling rivers. At its peak, Morgan was the second busiest port in South Australia (behind only Port Adelaide), with six trains a day carrying freight from the Murray to the sea at Port Adelaide. As road transport improved through the early part of the 20th century, river transport declined. The railway to Morgan finally closed in 1969.\r\nWar Memorial\r\nDespite these new developments, many historic buildings remain in the town. A number of these buildings have signs showing their former use and appearance. The two hotels, both historic, sit opposite each other, facing the riverfront.

It is 51 km north east of Adelaide and 16 km south-east of Gawler. Williamstown was originally known as Victoria Creek.[2] The village was laid out in 1858 by Lewis Johnston, or Johnstone, on land he purchased in 1857, and named for his son.[3]\r\nIn the late summer of 1956 Williamstown was struck by a large earthquake of an estimated magnitude 4.1 that lasted for almost eight minutes and caused structural damaged to many of the stone structures and brick buildings in the area that can be seen to this day. It is reported that domestic wells and sweetwater springs in the area dried up for several weeks thereafter due to the many landslips and seismic movement below the surrounding Gawler Range and local hills.\r\nWilliamstown is considered to be a \'Southern gateway\' town into the Barossa Valley itself and in recent years land releases and new family homes have brought a new lease of life to the sleepy little town which boasts one of the oldest public house hotels in South Australia dating from 1841and several original farm homesteads built by the first homesteaders from rough-cut slab timber. One excellent example of which can be found somewhere along Warren Road.\r\nWilliamstown was essentially a farming area with sheep and cattle in the early days with fruit orchards, mixed farms and vines. The town also sustained a forestry and lumber industry from the earliest days with three sawmills. Today only a small family owned mill remains with the closure of the two larger mills by 1990. Many residents work in the wine / viticulture industry throughout the Barossa Valley.\r\nThe Williamstown Oval is set in the welcome summer shade of a large wooded hill in a small valley ringed with a crystal clear cold water spring that feeds the stream that passes through the town. At the Oval there is a picnic area and small caravan park for visitors and transients alike overlooking the local Football Clubhouse and public swimming pool. In 1970 Williamstown had the happy pleasure of hosted one of the very last performances of the Barnum & Baily, Ringling Brothers Circus in the original Big Top at the Oval where their famous performing Elephants were enjoyed along with \'the world\'s smallest horse\' at just over five hands high.\r\nIn the springtime Williamstown is seen at its best with a carpet of green grass and wildflowers along the many creeks and thick woodlands covering the low rolling hills around the town dotted with large dairy pastures and vineyards.

The Freeling Hotel was founded in 1863, the Railway Hotel in 1867 and the St Petri Lutheran Church (now a private home) in 1871. By 1866, Freeling’s population numbered approximately 60.\r\nFreeling is a small town in South Australia, about 60 km north of Adelaide. It neighbours the Barossa Valley wine region. At the 2011 census, Freeling had a population of 1,591.[1]\r\nA major tourist attraction for the town and surrounding area is a popular Australian Drama television series, McLeod\'s Daughters. The town had many sets used on the show, including the Gungellan Hotel (previously the Railway Hotel), Truckstop and Showgrounds.\r\nThe main source of income for the town is its extensive farming land, where mainly cereal crops are grown. It is regarded as some of the best farming land in Australia, with the University of Adelaide\'s Roseworthy Campus, (Roseworthy, South Australia) situated nearby. The long-term rainfall average for Freeling is 475mm/Yr, this enables wheat crops of up to 5-6T/Ha to be grown as well as large tonnages of cereal hay, with thousands of acres of hay being harvested each year. A factory making farming implement blades and parts, has also been situated at Freeling for many years.[2]\r\nSport in Freeling include Australian rules football, netball, cricket, lawn bowls, basketball, skateboarding and tennis.\r\nFreeling is in the Light Regional Council, the state electoral district of Schubert and the federal Division of Wakefield.',0,-34.454289,138.813242),(12518,'Allendale North','5373','Barossa','Barossa - Yorke - Mid North','SA','Not yet populated',0,-34.303983,138.917658),(12519,'Bagot Well','5373','Barossa','Barossa - Yorke - Mid North','SA','The Postcode for Bagot Well is 5373.\r\nBagot Well (previously Bagot\'s Well) is a small village around 6 km north-east of Kapunda, South Australia on the road to Eudunda and was named for Captain C.

Samples were sent for assaying and the results were promising, silver and lead definitely being present. However no developments took place, which indicates that the lode could not have been as extensive as appeared at first. Even by 1965, fossickers still gleaned a little from this mineral deposit.[2]\r\nThe streets of Riverton received their names chiefly from James Masters and his friends. They commemorate persons notable in the history of the district or the State.[2]\r\nBoth the Gilbert Valley and Gilbert River were named after South Australian pioneer, Thomas Gilbert.\r\nRiverton is a small town in the Mid North of South Australia, in the Gilbert Valley. It is situated on the Gilbert River, from which the town derives its name. At the 2011 census, Riverton had a population of 810. Including the rural areas surrounding the town, the population was 1213.\r\nRiverton station was the scene of an attempted mass shooting in 1921. A passenger who was travelling on the Broken Hill Express from Adelaide fired a number of shots into the dining room, and Percy Brookfield, the Member of Parliament for Broken Hill, was shot and killed when he tried to disarm the gunman.[3]\r\nThe railways played a major part in the development of Riverton, both as a transport provider and as an employer. Today, the route of railway line from Riverton to Auburn has been converted into a walking/cycle rail trail, known as the Rattler Trail. The Rattler Trail joins the Riesling Trail at Auburn, providing a 43 km route from Riverton, through the heart of the Clare Valley wine region to the North.[2] The Peterbrough railway line is also closed, although no rail trail has been created.\r\nThe first storekeeper in the town, John Jubb Horner, arrived in South Australia in 1853 and soon made his way with his family to Riverton. His store, built in the early 1850s, was situated at the south end of the town. His store was the commercial emporium of Riverton, where the settlers would gather for social purposes as well as business. This store was also the original Post Office, Telegraph Office, and registry for births, deaths and marriages. The only other shop in the town in the early 1850s was owned by a cobbler, Mister Payne.[citation needed]\r\nThe town is within the District Council of Clare and Gilbert Valleys area.\r\nThe Riverton Hotel, originally known as the Riverton Arms, opened for business in 1855, although the building was not completed until 1857. This hotel, and the abovemention two shops, were the only business places in 1857.[2]\r\nThe transport problems for the Kapunda miners were eased in 1860 when the railway reached there. The question was whether the line should continue from Kapunda northwards along the valley of the River Light to Burra, or whether another line should stretch northwards from Gawler through the Gilbert Valley. The authorities decided on the latter route because it would open up thousands of acres of good agricultural land, encouraging the establishment of new towns along the route.\r\nIn 1918, the branch line to Clare was opened, which later extended to Spalding. This branch made it necessary for more railway employees to live at Riverton. In 1965, there were 25 railway employees and their families living there.\r\nThe massive buildings were the finest outside Adelaide, with the refreshment rooms being open for all passenger trains. At one time, passenger trains passing through Riverton had connections at Terowie to Broken Hill, Alice Springs and Perth. The refreshment rooms served a three-course dinner to east-west passengers and breakfast to Broken Hill passengers.\r\nRailway workshops were immediately set up in Riverton. This swelled the population and sharply increased trade generally in the town. However, the workshops closed in 1878.\r\nLocal Government was proclaimed in July 1866, the first Court House and Police Station were opened that same year, the new Post Office and the Community Hall were both built in 1874.\r\nRhynie is a small town in South Australia, halfway between Tarlee and Auburn, along the Horrocks Highway. It was surveyed and founded in 1859.\r\nThe station building now houses tea-rooms, a gallery and bed and breakfast accommodation. Renovated, ensuite railway carriages provide unusual accommodation.[4]\r\nLiberal politicians Clive Hannaford[5] and Trish Worth were born in Riverton.\r\nRiverton was first settled in 1856, as a settlement along the bullock track from the mining town of Burra to the capital city Adelaide. It grew from a plan designed by a James Masters who had established the nearby town of Saddleworth.[2]\r\nThat was a fortunate decision for Riverton.

The fertile district soon attracted farmers, leading to several small service towns being established, including Marrabel. In 1859 a local landholder, John E. Marrabel, laid out a town on part section 1122, Hundred of Waterloo, naming it Marrabel.[4]\r\nOn 3 December 1841 the London-based Secondary Towns Association, through their Adelaide agents John Hill and John Morphett, purchased the first of several special surveys, together known as the River Light Special Survey. Surveys conducted during 1842 throughout the valley of the Upper Light resulted in a survey map which included farming lands, town lands, and five-acre lots. That survey still largely influences modern land boundaries.[3] This speculative venture became doomed when copper was discovered at nearby Kapunda in 1842, subsequently attracting all local development. Many investors in the Special Survey lost their money.\r\nThe township grew rapidly and by 1865 it comprised a hotel, several churches, a school, two general stores, two blacksmiths, a post office, a steam flour mill, plus many other facilities.[5]\r\nThe handling of horses and livestock had always featured prominently in the township and district. In 1935 an annual rodeo began and has been held every October ever since, growing in popularity every year. One of the most notable Marrabel rodeo events took place in 1953, when buckjumper Alan Woods successfully rode a notoriously difficult horse named Curio. The ride became so legendary that a life size statue of horse and rider was commissioned to commemorate the event, which now stands prominently one end of the main street.\r\nMarrabel is a township and locality beside the Light River in South Australia\'s Mid North.[2] It is in the Clare and Gilbert Valleys Council local government area, 100 kilometres (62 mi) north west of the state capital, Adelaide.

Having established their head station near present Manoora, for a few years the brothers (or cousins) held extensive occupation licences reaching toward the Kapunda and Burra districts.[citation needed]',0,-33.977601,138.785706),(12576,'Stanley','5415','Lower North','Barossa - Yorke - Mid North','SA','Not yet populated',0,-33.894204,138.731274),(12577,'Farrell Flat','5416','Lower North','Barossa - Yorke - Mid North','SA','Farrell Flat Railway Station in 2013\r\nThe town was surveyed as Hanson in 1870 and did not officially become Farrell Flat until 19 September 1940.[2] The name Farrell’s Flat had been in use for some time, this being the name of the railway station.[3] The nearby town of Davies was officially renamed to Hanson on 19 September 1940.[3]\r\nFarrell Flat (formerly Hanson) is a town in South Australia.

This was the primary source for Burra until 1966 when it was replaced with water piped from the Murray River.[42] The Burra received its first supply of electricity on 27 March 1924 from the newly formed Burra electric supply company.[43]\r\nOn 9 June 1845 William Streair bore samples of a rich copper ore into the office of Henry Ayers,secretary of the South Australian Mining Association (SAMA). Streair, a young shepherd in the employ of local pastoralist James Stein, had walked the 90 miles from Burra [10] as did Thomas Pickett, a shepherd on a neighbouring property who made a further find. News of the copper this heralded was published on 21 June in Adelaide newspapers, and the site was soon named The Monster Mine.[11]\r\nFrom as early as 1843 shepherding had been common around Burra, with pastoral pioneers such as James Stein and William Peter being granted grazing rights for their flocks on unsurveyed land.[31] Over the life of the Burra Mine, most food was brought in as there was no freehold offered by SAMA on the land and no adjoining hundreds were declared until 1860. Agriculture was delayed by the slow surveying of hundreds, as until these had been done there was no freehold or leasehold land but only grazing rights. As Burra lies almost on Goyder\'s 1865 line it is rated at the edge of marginal land for farming. After mining the town became a pastoral centre, and South Australia\'s main sheep trading centre until the mid-20th century.[9] The Baldina Run, a major sheep station of 50 square miles some 10 miles east of Burra, near Kooringa, was established by Henry Ayers in 1851, leased by J and C. B. Fisher until 1862, then taken over by Alfred Barker, son-in-law of James Chambers.\r\nThere are no houses, the dwellings being excavated in the banks of the Burra Creek.[33]\r\nLlwchwr, sometimes spelled Llychwr, was built by the Patent Copper Company (later the English and Australian Copper Company) to avoid the need to ship all of the ore to Wales. The streets are named after street names in Llwchwr, Wales and other nearby villages. In May 1848, the company had imported from Swansea the entire smelting works comprising men, materials, tools, staff and families,[49] and smelting was reported to be in operation by May 1849.\r\nKooringa was the first company township in Australia [45] and, until the closure of the mine, was maintained as a strictly company-run town. The township\'s name is derived from the Aboriginal word kuri-ngga meaning either in the circle or locality of the sheoak.[9] During the life of the Burra Burra Mine, the township was widely reported as shabby, rundown and poorly maintained with the inhabitants having little incentive to maintain their rented properties. Kooringa is still the main section of the town and is known as Burra South.\r\nLargely due to the company nature of the settlement, development was slow, with the first bank not opening until 1859 and the town\'s first newspaper being printed in 1876. Until the National Bank established the first branch in Kooringa, most exchange was either in the form of company scrip or at shops operating as money exchanges.[34] All towns, except Kooringa, were built outside the mining lease but were still close to the mine as it was at the northern edge of the lease. The formation of the townships was forced by the refusal of SAMA to grant any freeholds within Kooringa, so miners began moving into other townships from the end of 1849. During their early lives each of the townships largely had their own hotels, churches, post offices, schools, and shops and identity.[35] In 1851 the gold rush near Bathurst, New South Wales, emptied the town of many miners.[36] Whole families, government officials and other townspeople left for the gold fields and by 1854 the town appeared largely deserted.[37] The number of townships increased dramatically as a result of an 1858 proposal to extend a railway line from Gawler. When the railway failed to be built most of the new townships failed and, in 1876, the remaining townships formed the Corporation of Burra.[38]\r\nIn 1846 a group of speculators from Scotland formed the Bon Accord Mining Company, purchasing a section of land on the northern boundary of the special survey, hoping that the ore body extended under the boundary. Due to the lack of success in mining company land near the mine was subdivided in 1849 forming Aberdeen (named after the east coastal city of Aberdeen in Scotland), with the company seeking to recoup some of their investment.[50] Streets were named to honour directors of the Bon Accord Mining Company and the retention of mineral rights by the company prevented SAMA from acquiring the land, as they had in Redruth.[51] New Aberdeen was subdivided after 1872 arrival of the railway line from Kapunda, and most of the early buildings in the two townships were constructed in the three yea',0,-33.682472,138.938323),(12582,'Burra Eastern Districts','5417','Lower North','Barossa - Yorke - Mid North','SA','Not yet populated',0,-33.793633,139.213781),(12583,'Gum Creek','5417','Lower North','Barossa - Yorke - Mid North','SA','Not yet populated',0,-33.706382,138.774938),(12584,'Hanson','5417','Lower North','Barossa - Yorke - Mid North','SA','Not yet populated',0,-33.754540,138.838335),(12585,'Koonoona','5417','Lower North','Barossa - Yorke - Mid North','SA','Not yet populated',0,-33.818656,138.926290),(12586,'Leighton','5417','Lower North','Barossa - Yorke - Mid North','SA','Not yet populated',0,-33.658087,138.770663),(12587,'Mongolata','5417','Lower North','Barossa - Yorke - Mid North','SA','Not yet populated',0,-33.581186,139.075380),(12588,'North Booborowie','5417','Lower North','Barossa - Yorke - Mid North','SA','Not yet populated',0,-33.477886,138.780388),(12589,'Collinsville','5418','Lower North','Barossa - Yorke - Mid North','SA','Not yet populated',0,-33.351680,139.105314),(12590,'Mount Bryan','5418','Lower North','Barossa - Yorke - Mid North','SA','Mount Bryan is a town in north-east South Australia.

It was one of 69 places in South Australia renamed in 1917 due to anti-German sentiments during World War I.\r\nThe first settlers in the area purchased land from the government in 1875. The first building in the town was constructed four years later. Settler Peter Doecke transferred his land to J H Koch in 1876, who found out in 1880 that the land would be the site of a railway junction. He subdivided it and sold 33 acres (13 ha) for £1700, after failing to get £500 for it in 1879.[2] By 1880 a hotel and post office had been erected, followed by a school in 1883, and a town hall in 1884.[3] At the prompting of mayor W. Thredgold, a newspaper, the Petersburg Times was founded in 1887 by Robert M. Osborne, became The Times and Northern Advertiser in 1919, under the longterm proprietorship of W. H.

The (corrugated iron) Presbyterian church has gone, the Catholic Church was demolished (around the 1960s), the main store (home and post office) is now stone rubble with a chimney.\r\nThe town was planned to have several streets with suburban style yards, however this never eventuated. The Nackara township never consisted of more than a few railway cottages, a town store/post office (part of a house), a community hall (\'The Nackara Institute\'), a Catholic church, a Presbyterian Church, a school, the railway platform, cattle yards and cemetery. The planned roads didn\'t ever eventuate, with only dirt tracks through the very dry paddocks.\r\nThe community consisted of families from the surrounding grazing land, and the railway workers. While the township never grew as planned, the community did have many social events such as picnics, town dances and concerts, annual horse races, and car races. The town also competed against the other local towns in at least rugby and cricket.',0,-32.800617,139.249879),(12648,'Waukaringa','5440','Mid North','Barossa - Yorke - Mid North','SA','Waukaringa is a locality in the Australian state of South Australia located about 303 kilometres (188 mi) north-east of the state capital of Adelaide and about 35 kilometres (22 mi) north of Yunta in the state\'s Far North region.[1]\r\nThe name was first used for a town surveyed in 1888 and which was formally declared to have ceased to exist in 1982. Boundaries which include the former town were created for the locality in 1997 and which are completely surrounded by Melton Station.[1]\r\nThe setting for The Silent Sea, written by Catherine Edith Macauley Martin under the pseudonym Mrs. Alick Macleod, was based on mining and life at Waukaringa. The book was partly written while Martin lived in the town.[8]\r\nAustralian Rules footballer Harold Oliver was born in Waukaringa in 1891.[9]\r\nThe area was initially settled in 1873 with the discovery of gold. In 1890, Waukaringa was estimated to have had a population of 750.[4] The former town of Waukaringa is now a ghost town after being abandoned in the 1950s.[5] Ruins of only a few buildings remain, principally the former Waukaringa Hotel.\r\nThe goldfields near Waukaringa produced approximately 1,427 kilograms (3,146 lb) of gold between 1873 and 1969.[6] The main mines in the goldfield were Alma and Victoria, Alma Extended, West Waukaringa and Balaclava.[6] A stone chimney from the Alma and Victoria mine is still visible.[5] The Alma and Victoria Mine Site and Structures are listed on the South Australian Heritage Register.[7]',0,-32.299345,139.439276),(12649,'Yunta','5440','Mid North','Barossa - Yorke - Mid North','SA','Yanta was an early spelling.

In the early 1890s the village was a busy railway town on the Adelaide to Broken Hill line. From 1934 Yunta was the base for the famed outback trucking and mail contractor Harry Ding.[3]\r\nThere is a RV waste dump located between the railway line and the highway at the western end of town. The main annual event is the Yunta Picnic Races and gymkhana held in May.[5]\r\nVillage facilities include a hotel offering meals and accommodation, two roadhouses (one with caravan sites), two fuel stations, post office, Rural Transaction Centre offering internet access, police station, air strip and a primary school. A rest area with public toilets is located opposite the hotel.\r\nToday Yunta is a small service centre for travellers and the surrounding properties. Yunta also provides an alternate route to the Flinders Ranges and beyond.

The Auburn oval hosts sporting facilities for cricket, bowls and netball and is also the location of a small, self-contained caravan park.\r\nIt lies in the northern Mount Lofty Ranges just east of the Skilly Hills. Auburn is bisected by the Wakefield River as it makes its way to the sea at Port Wakefield.\r\nVery soon after, just outside the southwest corner of this survey, a pioneering character named William Tateham squatted on the Wakefield River, living in a riverbank dugout from where he provided hospitality to travellers. The spot, which later became the site of Auburn, was for a time named Tateham\'s Waterhole or Billy Tatum\'s because of this.[2]\r\nCWA Clubrooms, Main North Road\r\nThe first European to explore through the Auburn district, in April 1839, was John Hill, who was followed one month later by Edward John Eyre. On 10 March 1840 John Morphett selected a special survey of 4,000 acres on the Wakefield River as land agent for three English investors, Admiral George Lambert, Edward Rice M.P., and Robert Slaney M.P..\r\nIn October 1849, Thomas Henry Williams, a copper-smelting superintendent at the Burra mines, received a land grant for what was to become the Auburn area. During the next few years Williams sold off allotments to bullock teamsters and others. The first building – a well-appointed hotel named the Rising Sun Inn – was built in 1850 and so the town of Auburn was begun.\r\nRising Sun Hotel\r\nAuburn is a small town in the southern edge of the Clare Valley, in the Mid North of South Australia.\r\nInstitute building\r\nOften considered the Gateway to the Clare Valley, the town is on the Horrocks Highway, approximately 111 kilometres from the state\'s capital, Adelaide and 25 kilometres south of the town of Clare.\r\nAuburn is in the District Council of Clare and Gilbert Valleys, the state electoral district of Frome, and the Australian House of Representatives Division of Wakefield.\r\nFormer railway station, now a cellar door\r\nAuburn always was a transport hub. In the 1850s it was on the Gulf Road, used by bullock teamsters carting copper ore from Burra, through Mintaro, to Hoyles Plains and on to Port Wakefield.[3] Today it is on the Horrocks Highway, connecting Adelaide to the north, and also connects the Riverland district with Yorke Peninsula. The southern end of the Riesling Trail also begins here, alongside the former railway station, which is now a winery cellar door.\r\nAuburn is the birthplace of Australian poet, C. J. Dennis (born 1876), who lived for a time in the former Auburn Hotel, which has since been demolished. A small tributary of the Wakefield River, Dennis Creek runs through the town and was named in honour of his father, who was a local publican 1868-80.

Clare lies in the state electoral district of Frome and the federal electoral division of Division of Wakefield.\r\nThe first European to explore the district was John Hill, who in April 1839 discovered and named the Wakefield River and Hutt River. In early 1840 the first European settlers arrived in the district, led by John Horrocks. The town itself was established in 1842 by Edward Burton Gleeson, and named after his ancestral home of County Clare in Ireland.[3]\r\nThe town was first named Inchiquin.

It was built by Gordon Ross and William Robins and now stands by the side of Main North Road, near St Mark\'s Church.\r\nThe following year saw the completion of an inn, The Derby Arms, which was built to accommodate the many new travellers passing north through Penwortham. The year after that (1842), the first foundations were laid for a flour mill, which did not see full operation until 1856, when all its working parts finally arrived from Europe. 1842 was also the year that the first foundation stone was laid down for the beginning of the manor house at Hope Farm.\r\nPenwortham is surrounded by natural eucalyptus bushland and a section of the Skilly Hills, which in turn forms part of the Mount Lofty Ranges. There are two significant peaks nearby, Mount Oakden named after John Oakden, and Mount Horrocks, named after John Horrocks. The Hill River rises about 3 kilometres east of Penwortham.\r\nPenwortham shares its name with the town of Penwortham in Lancashire, England. Penwortham (in the United Kingdom) was the home of Richard Arkwright, the inventor of the water frame that kick-started the textile industry in the late 18th century. John Horrocks is likely to have been a descendant of Arkwright. Penwortham is a town name with a precise meaning: a settlement on a hill by a ford. Horrocks originally called his settlement Penwortham-on-the-Hill. He was born at his family home of Penwortham Hall, near Preston, Lancashire. The name is a hybrid of the Welsh pen, meaning headland and an Old English word worphamm, meaning enclosed homestead.\r\nHorrocks died in 1846 as a result of a hunting accident at Lake Gill, just north of the present day city of Port Augusta. By that time, Penwortham had become quite an established town and included a butcher, general store, tailor, school and blacksmith. The next year (1847), an unofficial post office began operation, with the local publican, James Bleechmore, acting as postmaster. In 1851, building began on St Mark\'s Anglican Church. Completion of St Mark\'s occurred in 1855, with the installation of a bell, turret and porch.\r\nA new era of transport and industry began in 1915, when the construction of the Riverton to Spalding railway line passed through the town. It brought about many changes, and included the demolition of the manor house at Hope Farm, as this was in its direct line. By now, the main industries in the town and surrounding farms were fruit, dried currant and dairy production. These continued until just after the Second World War, when competition from the Riverland meant that a viable industry in the Clare Valley was untenable. As a result, the pre-war advent and post-war continuation of the fledgling wine industry began to flourish in the region.\r\nThe village of Penwortham was originally founded by settler, pioneer and explorer, John Horrocks (22 March 1818 – 23 September 1846). Horrocks arrived in the colony of South Australia on his 21st birthday, 22 March 1839, less than three years after its proclamation by Governor John Hindmarsh. After meeting Edward John Eyre, who told him of potentially good farmland to the north of Adelaide, John Horrocks and a servant, John Green, set off to find the area Eyre had described to him. Horrocks settled in a region that he believed to be along the Hutt River and named his establishment Hope Farm. Later in 1839, the first stone cottage of the settlement was commenced and, in 1840, Horrocks and his servants built stone stables for horses, which were then very rare and valuable in the new colony. For a short time, this was the only inland European settlement north of Adelaide and Gawler.\r\nPenwortham is in the District Council of Clare and Gilbert Valleys, the state electoral district of Frome, and the Australian Hous',0,-33.921256,138.639291),(12665,'Polish Hill River','5453','Lower North','Barossa - Yorke - Mid North','SA','Not yet populated',0,-33.889439,138.670828),(12666,'Sevenhill','5453','Lower North','Barossa - Yorke - Mid North','SA','Not yet populated',0,-33.890255,138.629068),(12667,'Spring Farm','5453','Lower North','Barossa - Yorke - Mid North','SA','Not yet populated',0,-33.853441,138.635976),(12668,'Spring Gully','5453','Lower North','Barossa - Yorke - Mid North','SA','Not yet populated',0,-33.908684,138.578265),(12669,'Stanley Flat','5453','Lower North','Barossa - Yorke - Mid North','SA','Stanley Flat is governed at the local level by the District Council of Clare and Gilbert Valleys, located within the state electoral district of Frome and the federal electoral division of Wakefield.\r\nStanley Flat is a locality located in the Mid North region of South Australia about 6 kilometres (3.7 mi) north of Clare along the Main North Road.

The Balaklava Courthouse Gallery began within the ranks of Balaklava Community Arts and now holds widely known exhibitions and competitions in visual arts. The Balaklava Community Arts group continues to nurture the local artistic talents and entertain the community with performing arts by both local and visiting artists, promoting the arts to the wider community.\r\nAs the Balaklava railway station was originally on the Port Wakefield to Hoyleton line, before the railway from Hamley Bridge was built, and that line entered the town from the southeast, trains travelling using the route between Gladstone and Adelaide needed to change direction at Balaklava, as both the north and south lines entered the station from the east, with Port Wakefield being to the west.[7]\r\nThe Hundred of Balaklava is a cadastral unit of hundred located on the northern Adelaide Plains in South Australia immediately south of the Wakefield River.[9] It is one of the eight hundreds of the County of Gawler.[10] It was named in 1856 by Governor Dominick Daly after the Crimean War Battle of Balaklava.[9] The township of Balaklava is at the extreme north east corner of the Hundred.\r\nThe Balaklava Golf Club[15] is a 18-hole 5,987 metre championship golf course fully watered year round and has clubhouse facilities. The Balaklava Gliding Club[16] is located at Whitwarta, 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) north-west of the township. Flying operations are normally on every weekend or by prior arrangement.\r\nBalaklava is well known for its interest and support in the arts.[by whom?] The Balaklava Eisteddfod Society[13] holds its own music and speech/drama Eisteddfod every year in early August. It has been running since 1997 and is a very major event for the township.\r\nThe Gulf Road copper ore traffic came to a sudden end in 1857 when a railway connected Gawler to Port Adelaide which provided a more economic path for exporting the ore. The teamster\'s loads were replaced by a flow of pastoral produce to Port Wakefield, mainly wool and grain. The town was laid out by Charles Fisher in 1869 and named it after the Battle of Balaklava.[3] He built large grain stores on the tramway from Hoyleton to the port at Port Wakefield, intending to encourage farmers to settle near the town.[4] The first Hotel erected in the new township of Balaklava was the Balaklava Hotel, later called the Royal. Thomas Saint borrowed the finances from Thomas James Manton and applied for the Hotel Keepers Licence on 17 November 1870 and was granted licence No.17 of 1871 on 4 April 1871.\r\nTown hall and institute\r\nBalaklava hosts the annual Balaklava Cup horse racing carnival on the first Wednesday each September.[12] It also has an agricultural show in September each year. This major event showcases the regions many achievements, in agriculture, horse riding, baking, art and the local schools achievements as well as many fun things for the family to enjoy.\r\nUniting church\r\nBalaklava has several sporting facilities and clubs with regular competitions, such as the local basketball and tennis in summer, local football and netball in winter, and the squash courts which open all year. The football oval and basketball, netball and tennis courts are centralised at one location. Balaklava has its own pool, open from November through to April each year.\r\nBalaklava was subjected to wind blown contamination from British nuclear tests, and is home to long time nuclear veteran campaigner Avon Hudson.[8]\r\nThe following localities of the Wakefield Council area are situated inside (or largely inside) the bounds of the Hundred of Balaklava:\r\nThe local newspaper is the Plains Producer.[11]\r\nPost office\r\nNeighbouring townships to Balaklava include:\r\nSince prehistoric times the Balaklava district has been near the boundaries of the Kaurna and Peramangk peoples.

The census also found that over half the population of Port Broughton is over 55, with the median age being 61, suggesting the town is popular with retirees. Christianity is the dominant religion in the region, and is well serviced by a number of churches.\r\nPort Broughton was surveyed in 1871 to service the surrounding wheat and barley growers on the recommendation of Captain Henry Dale.

It is situated about 170 km north west of Adelaide, and 56 km south of Port Pirie At the 2011 census, the town of Port Broughton had a population of 982.[1]\r\nThe close proximity (two hours drive from Adelaide) makes it a popular tourist destination, with the number of people in town swelling to over 4000 in the summer holidays.\r\nLying on the eastern side of Spencer Gulf, Port Broughton\'s coastline is relatively protected, resulting in large expanses of shallow water and seagrasses, tidal flats and vast areas of mangroves that flank the inlet on which the town is built. The small town of Fisherman Bay lies 5 km north of Port Broughton and has much the same coastal features. Between the mouth of Fisherman Bay and Port Broughton lies Shag Island, an important breeding site for several species of cormorant. The Broughton River lies further north toward Port Pirie, where its estuary is located. Further inland, most of the land is fairly featureless farming country, with only fragments of the original vegetation remaining.\r\nBuilt in 1876, the \'T\'-shaped jetty was serviced by an isolated narrow gauge railway line from Mundoora, 16 km inland and uphill. The Port Broughton railway line, officially opened on 11 March 1876, brought the grain down to the port. Horses were used to tow the empty wagons uphill, but they were sent downhill powered only by gravity, with a driver to operate the brakes. The passenger service ceased on 17 September 1925, but the grain traffic continued. During January, 1926, a Fordson rail tractor displaced the animal power.

The Solomontown railway station was formerly in the southwest corner of the town. It had a suburban rail service to Port Pirie in 1911.[3] The Port Pirie Junction station was newly built in 1937 as the break-of-gauge junction between the South Australian Railways broad gauge from the south and the Commonwealth Railways standard gauge from the north on the site of the older Solomontown station on the Port Pirie-Cockburn railway line. (officially known as Port Pirie Junction with both names on the signboard)[4] The station was replaced and closed in 1967, and later demolished.\r\nSolomontown is a settlement in South Australia.[1] It is now essentially a suburb of Port Pirie, but was historically a separate town.

Accommodation is available at several places in town, including the Port Wakefield Motel (located just off the highway) and the Port Wakefield Caravan Park.\r\nIn 1927, these railways, and the remainder of the Western system that grew from them, were converted to the broad 1,600 mm (5 ft 3 in) gauge.[10]\r\nWilliam Hanson, Manager for Railways, selected a route for a horse-drawn tramway terminating at Hoyles Plains, later renamed Hoyleton. The enabling Act provided for a tramway of 28 miles 41 chains (45.9 km) in length to a gauge of 1,067 mm (3 ft 6 in), the first line in South Australia built to that gauge. Subsequently, the Government agreed that the line should be operated by a private body. The successful tenderer was one Paul Badcock who opened the line to traffic on 4 January 1870. Horses were worked in three relays between the stations on the route.\r\nLocated thus, Port Wakefield is known mostly for its roadhouses and trucking stops, including Shell, United, Tucker Time and BP. Travellers between Adelaide and any of the Flinders Ranges, Yorke Peninsula, Eyre Peninsula or the Nullarbor Plain will likely travel through Port Wakefield.\r\nThe town was originally named Port Henry by William Hill.[7] The name of the town was, around 1849, changed to Port Wakefield, after the Wakefield River.[8]\r\nIn 1848, the Patent Copper Company agreed to build and operate a smelter at Burra. Seeking to reduce cartage costs, a track was surveyed to its port established at the mouth of the River Wakefield. By securing leases of the appropriate Crown Land, the company obtained a monopoly of the port. The Government declared the track the Great Western Road. The wharf was constructed along the bank of the river and cargo was transferred between the wharf and ships at anchor in the Gulf on lighters.\r\nPort Wakefield is a major stop on the Adelaide – Yorke Peninsula and Adelaide – Port Augusta road routes. Just north of the township there is a major forked intersection where the Yorke Peninsula traffic diverges west onto the Copper Coast Highway from the main Augusta Highway. The intersection is notorious for road accidents and traffic delays, especially at the end of holidays and long weekends.[11][12]\r\nPort Wakefield (formerly Port Henry) was the first government town to be established north of the capital, Adelaide, in South Australia.\r\nWith the opening of the railway from Adelaide to Gawler in 1857, the Copper Company\'s traffic came to a sudden end, leaving only pastoral produce to flow to the port. Mixed farming was established on lands opening up by the Government along the River in the mid-1860s and this called for improvement in transport to the Port.\r\nPort Wakefield is situated 98.7 kilometres (61.3 mi) from the Adelaide city centre and lies on the Port Wakefield Road section of the A1 National Highway. Port Wakefield is situated on the River Wakefield, at the head of the Gulf St Vincent.\r\nThe choice of gauge was influenced by the argument that costs varied with the cube of the gauge.[9] As this railway had its own port, it was not expected to link up with any broad gauge railways which avoided of course any break of gauge problems.\r\nFollowing a surrender of the lease, the line was taken over by the Government at the end of 1870.\r\nOn 1 March 1876 the line was extended from Hoyleton to Blyth. Steam locomotives were subsequently obtained and, by August, 1876, the entire line was being worked by steam power.

The first European explorers to traverse Northern Yorke Peninsula were John Hill and Thomas Burr, on horseback. On 28 April 1840 they camped overnight near present Paskeville and later reported they had discovered extensive fertile land there.[5] The Paskeville district was soon occupied by sheep graziers, who held occupation licences until closer settlement came two decades later.\r\nThe Hundred of Kulpara was proclaimed on 12 June 1862. Surveys soon followed, including the surveyed township of Kulpara. Pioneer farmers cleared the land for cropping, but there was no town at Paskeville until 1878, when a station was established on the new Port Wakefield to Kadina railway. Up until that time the name Green\'s Plains had applied to this district. The surveyed town which surrounded this station was on 4 March 1880 named after General Edward Hanson Paske, brother-in-law of the incumbent Governor, Sir William Jervois.\r\nThe township of Paskeville soon provided commercial and community support services, including churches, a school, grocer and baker, and a hotel (originally named the Railway Hotel). Gaslight came to Paskeville in 1903, a new post office in 1925, and a 32-volt power supply until 1953. The township thrived for a time, but the closure of the railway, plus better roads and shopping options, eventually stalled its growth.\r\nThe original geography of Northern Yorke Peninsula was of scrub-covered undulating plains, almost devoid of watercourses. Since European settlement the scrub has mostly been cleared, with the exception of roadside remnants, leaving a dominant landscape of undulating grain fields. Paskeville is sited upon a plateau which, although low-lying, affords clear and distant views in certain directions across the surrounding region. The geology, which is dominated by limestone overlaid by ancient sand dunes, was quickly exhausted by pioneer cropping, but modern farming methods and fertilisers make this a highly productive food bowl.\r\nPaskeville biennially hosts the Yorke Peninsula Field Days[6] (YPFD), a three-day field day with a major focus on agriculture, and the future, the event features extensive displays of the latest agricultural machinery and equipment, technology, information and services. The event also offers a variety of displays designed to be of interest to both rural and urban families. The event, which since 1975 has been held on a permanent site approximately 3 km west of the township, attracts an Australia wide attendance.\r\nIn February 2008 a Kadina man was lured to Paskeville where he was ambushed by four men and shot at least 15 times at close range, before staggering into the Paskeville Hotel. The offenders fled, leaving the man in a critical but stable condition. Remarkably, he survived. The victim was linked to the shooting death of a bikie gang member at Wallaroo in May 2004, for which he had been tried and acquitted.\r\nThe railway yards at Paskeville were soon busily thronged by local farmers with transhipments of bagged wheat and barley, as well as wool. Goods sheds were built in 1887, while silos were built later for bulk grain handling. These products were generally exported through the port of Wallaroo.\r\nPaskeville is a town on South Australia\'s Yorke Peninsula.

These products are now transported in bulk form by road. A 1911 newspaper reported that most of the ketches visiting Price via Wills Creek had, on at least one visit, suffered the inconvenience of being stuck in the mud of the creek at low tide.[7]\r\nAlthough not right on the coast, Price has a causeway running to a mangrove-fringed tidal creek, Wills Creek, which connects it with the sea (Gulf St Vincent). At the end of the causeway there is a public boat ramp. Once outside the creek, fishing is plentiful.[citation needed]\r\nThe principal local industries are grain farming and salt production. In the case of the latter, sea salt is harvested from coastal salt pans.\r\nIt was named by Sir William Jervois, Governor of South Australia 1877-83, after his daughter in law, Florence Annie Price, who married John Jervois, his eldest son. She was a daughter of Henry Strong Price, a pioneer pastoralist of the Flinders Ranges.

The residents of the new township petitioned the government for a jetty in 1874. Completed in 1877, this was later extended to better accommodate the larger steamships and windjammers used to export grain overseas. By 1878 there were six houses, a post office, a flour mill, a Methodist church, and a hotel. That same year a public school opened, having 53 pupils.[6]\r\nThe historic shipwreck of the Zanoni is located approximately 15 miles offshore and is a popular scuba diving location. This ship originally sank on 11 February 1867 and was discovered on 17 April 1983 after 116 years. It is one of the best preserved examples of 19th century merchant sailing vessels in Australia.[14]\r\nThe Hundred of Cunningham was proclaimed 19 June 1873, comprising 134 square miles, and surveying commenced. The Hundred had two government surveyed towns, namely Ardrossan, proclaimed 13 November 1873, and Price, proclaimed 3 August 1882.\r\nArdrossan today is in the Yorke Peninsula Council, the state electorate of Goyder and the federal Division of Grey.[5][3][2]\r\nArdrossan jetty\r\nGrain farming and pastoralism continue to be a mainstay of the local economy.\r\nIn 1859 partners Parker Bowman (1831-1911) and Edmund Parnell (c.1834-87) took over the Parara leases. After these expired in 1865 the government moved toward establishing closer settlement and grain farming.\r\nToday, tourism plays an increasingly large part in Ardrossan\'s economy with the town being a popular destination for Adelaide residents on weekends. While it lacks an attractive swimming beach, it is a popular location to catch fish and blue crabs which are abundant during the months of September through April each year. The town\'s two jetties are also suitable for scuba-diving, with easy entries and plentiful marine life to observe.\r\nArdrossan, like most of the Yorke Peninsula, has a maritime climate. Summers are warm and winters are mild (although they can be cool) and usually wet.\r\nBeing at a site formerly known as Clay Gully, after a deep gully leading to its red clay coastal cliffs, the surveyed town of Ardrossan was named by Governor Fergusson after the Ardrossan seaport in Scotland which shared similar geography - \'ard\' a height, and \'ros\' prominent rock or headland.\r\nRoyal House Hotel\r\nFirst Street\r\nThe wharf is being considered for the future export of iron ore and copper concentrates by Rex Minerals Ltd.[8]\r\nDuring the late 1800s, and into the early 20th century, the town expanded steadily due to income from the surrounding farms. As well, it became notable as the location of Clarence Smith\'s factory where he manufactured the Stump-jump plough between 1880 and 1935. This South Australian invention was vital in opening mallee country throughout Australia to the plough.\r\nSouth Australia\'s only recorded group stranding of sperm whales occurred on Parara Beach about 4 kilometres (2.5 mi) south of Ardrossan on 8 December 2014. Seven dead or dying whales were discovered stranded in the intertidal zone south of the BHP jetty.[9] Six of the whales were located in a loose group along several hundred metres of shoreline, with another whale located further to the north. The South Australian museum announced that it would sample the bodies and attempt to collect a complete skeleton for the museum, commencing work on December 10.[10] Biopsy samples were formally taken from five of the whales by AMWRRO[expand acronym] for analysis on December 9. AMWRRO rejected the proposition that any whales featured propeller strike marks, claiming that the marks they observed were tooth raking marks,[11] resulting from behavior more commonly known to occur among orcas. Several teeth were illegally removed from the animals overnight on December 8.[11][12]\r\nThe first European settlers were pastoralists who established sheep runs. Pastoral Lease No. 232, comprising 27 sq. miles, was taken up in 1852 by William Sharples. Stretching along the coastline, this was known as Parara (or Parrana/Pirana), meaning \'middle\' in Narungga language, with the homestead near Parara Landing, about three kilometres south of present Ardrossan. Northward of Ardrossan are coastal springs, named Tiddy Widdy or Tittiwitti by the Narungga, being a scarce natural source of fresh water in this region.\r\nAlthough the surrounding grain farmers continued to prosper, there was little change in the size of the town during the early 1900s. Indeed, after the depression in the 1930s, the town and its businesses were largely stagnant until a large open-cut dolomite mine was opened by the Broken Hill Proprietary Company (BHP) in the 1950s for use in its steel manufacture at Whyalla on the Eyre Peninsula and Port Kembla in New South Wales.

In 1882 a jetty was built. Wide enough to roll wool bales out to the ships, the locals came to know the jetty as Wool Bay jetty and by 1940, the name of the town had also changed to Wool Bay.[6] For many years, the town functioned as a wool, grain and lime exporting port.\r\nCommunity lobbying for a jetty commenced in 1879: the people believed that deep water in the bay would provide safer anchorage than other nearby locations. Eventually in 1882 construction of a jetty was undertaken by Frank George. Originally 155 metres long, it provided a depth of 2.1 metres at low tide. When lime burning became an established industry at Wool Bay the jetty was extended by a further 18 metres in anticipation of increased use. During this time, a steamship service dropped off and picked up provisions three times a week. When bulk-handling of grain was introduced at Port Giles in 1970, Wool Bay\'s importance as a port dwindled.\r\nWool Bay (formerly Pickering) is a locality and a former government town in the Australian state of South Australia on the east coast of southern Yorke Peninsula. It is located between Stansbury and Coobowie on the Yorke Peninsula, approximately 220 kilometres from Adelaide by road.\r\nToday, the jetty at Wool Bay is popular with anglers. It is known for producing good catches of Squid and tommies throughout the year while Garfish, Mullet and Snook and other species can be caught in season. The jetty is also used by recreational scuba divers, drawn by the population of leafy sea dragons that can be found inhabiting the waters beneath the jetty.\r\nBetween 1900 and 1910, six lime kilns were built on top of, and along the base of, the rugged cliffs overlooking the bay. Lime was burnt to create quicklime, an important ingredient in mortar and brick-making. Today, the ruins of only one kiln remain. Perched precariously on the side of the cliff, or so it seems when looking up from the jetty, this kiln was the cutting edge of wood-fired lime burning technology when it was built by Mr Miller from David Miller & Sons, and opened in 1910.[7] Technological changes and a decrease in the demand for lime during the 1950s and 1960s led to the closure of the Wool Bay kilns. Most of the remaining kilns and supporting infrastructure were demolished in the 1970s. Today, the town of wool bay is popular with holiday makers. The beach of Wool Bay features a permanently moored pontoon which is maintained by the local progress association, several sun shelters and a cement boat ramp.

It is reported that six million tonnes (6,000,000 long tons) of gypsum was extracted from sites at Marion, Inneston and Spider Lakes between the years 1905 and 1973. In 1970, mining continued on land not included in Innes National Park and is reported as ceasing sometime immediately prior to 2003.[13]\r\nIn 1913, the mining of gypsum was commenced at Inneston Lake by the Permasite Company, a Victorian enterprise owned by Messrs. Bell, Stenhouse and Innes, and who developed infrastructure at both the lake and at a settlement on the coastline that would subsequently be named as Stenhouse Bay and including a railway connecting both sites. The development at Inneston Lake grew into a town known as Inneston and which by the early 1900s has a population of about 150 people and included facilities such as “a public hall, butcher, baker, bank and post office.” Later developments included a plaster factory built in 1916, a chalk factory opened in 1922 and as of 1927, the town had “tennis court, cricket and other recreational facilities.”\r\nLand within Inneston was first used in 1847 by William Burrage to graze sheep near Cape Spencer. In 1851, land in the vicinity of Cape Spencer became available for leasing and by 1855, Burrage held two leases. Water for grazing was sourced from wells fed by “natural springs.” Wells were established at Pondalowie Bay and Browns Beach during the 1850s and allowed “the establishment of sheep stations at Cape Spencer, Carribie and Stone Hut in the 1860s.” Cropping was carried out within the locality with “poor yields due to the intense coastal environment and soil infertility.” After 1927, land under cultivation increased due to “a better understanding of the importance of trace elements (mainly manganese).”[12]\r\nThe following three lakes which support a population of stromatolites are listed on the South Australian Heritage Register maintained by the South Australian Government - Deep Lake, Inneston Lake and Marion Lake.[19][20][21]\r\nInneston (previously known as Cape Spencer) is a locality in the Australian state of South Australia located on the south-western end of Yorke Peninsula about 155 kilometres (96 mi) west of the Adelaide city centre.

The national park was enlarged during the years 1977, 1984 and 1993 in “response to significant recreational use.”[14]\r\nThe locality is serviced by a road connected to the western end of the Yorke Highway which passes through Marion Bay and then Stenhouse Bay and which follows the coastline as a sealed road passing Chinamans Hat Island, Cable Bay and the turn-offs to Cape Spencer, Ethel Beach, West Cape and Pondalowie Bay.

Emus used to drink here, and thus it was named by the indigenous inhabitants.[citation needed]\r\nOn 19 November 2009 a large fire started in paddocks near Curramulka.[10] The front was about 700 metres long and burnt about 400 hectares.[11] The fire was soon terminated and had caused minimal damage to local areas with the exception of a few paddocks burnt.\r\nNearby is an extensive chain of limestone caves. They were first explored in 1850, and major extensions discovered in 1984. They have 14km of known passages in an area of approximately 400m x 300m and depth 46m.[7] Corra-Lynn is the longest cave in the region.[8]\r\n1878[2]\r\nFarming land was first opened up in the mid-1870s and Curramulka enjoyed its heyday in the late 19th and early 20th centuries when most farming produce moved through nearby Port Julia.[citation needed]\r\nThe town\'s commercial importance dwindled when Ardrossan to the north became the main regional port for wheat and wool, but recent signs indicate that Curramulka is back in a strong growth mode.[9]',0,-34.667404,137.756150),(12891,'Port Vincent','5581','Yorke Peninsula','Barossa - Yorke - Mid North','SA','\r\nIn its early days it was a port exporting wheat, barley, wool and mallee stumps (firewood). From the first settlement in 1852 until 1877, coastal trading ketches would beach at high tide, and unload directly to farm wagons at low tide. A jetty was built into the bay in 1877, construction of a wharf began in 1901, and the original jetty was removed in 1918. Port Vincent was the main entry point for people and goods to and from the Yorke Peninsula until a good road was built from Port Wakefield in around 1949. Three major fuel companies had storage and distribution depots in the town, supplied by boat or barge from Port Adelaide.[5]\r\nA seaside holiday destination for many years, recently it has been the site of a marina development.

The first European pioneers arrived in the 1840s and were sheep graziers and pastoralists. With closer settlement, in 1869 the Marine Board fixed a site for a jetty to service the developing farming district. An adjacent town was then surveyed, the layout closely emulating (on a smaller scale) that of Adelaide, with a belt of parklands. Edithburgh was named by Governor Sir James Fergusson after his wife Edith. The new jetty opened in 1873.[7]\r\nIn December 2013, maintenance works were conducted at the Edithburgh jetty by a contractor working for the local council. An estimated 50 jetty pylons were removed from the periphery of the jetty. They were either sawed off at the seabed, or pulled up from the substrate. This resulted in an immediate loss of habitat and marine life, upsetting many members of the scuba diving and marine conservation community.[13][14]\r\nFor those who prefer not to swim in the open sea, the town has a unique seawater swimming pool constructed at the shoreline. Its sheltered waters are refreshed with each rising tide.[8]\r\nMany divers, scientists and marine conservationists list Edithburgh jetty as one of South Australia\'s premier shore-dive locations. Access is easy thanks to steps on northern and southern sides of the structure.[9]\r\nThe jetty extends eastwards into Gulf St Vincent and is 170 m in length. The jetty is supported by pylons in groups of four.[9] Divers and snorkelers can safely and closely observe dense, multi-coloured colonies of temperate corals and sponges on the jetty pylons. The pylons also provide refuges for various fish, crustacea, nudibranchs and other marine invertebrates.\r\nEdithburgh originally developed as a port for servicing the pastoralist pioneers. In the 1870s grain farming became a mainstay of the local economy, which it still is. At the turn of the 20th Century additional industries were established in the form of gypsum mining and salt refining. There are vast salt lakes in the area, from which salt was scraped and exported as far as Russia. Among those refineries was the Standard Salt Company, operated by C.T. McGlew. The jetty became a busy hub for exporting these commodities, as well as unloading supplies.\r\nRecreational divers from M.E. Dive Club witnessed the early works and arranged a group of divers to informally assess the damage the following weekend. The pylon removal works were not publicly advertised nor was the dive or tourism community consulted on the works. The Scuba Divers Federation of South Australia and the Marine Life Society of South Australia both responded to the issue by drafting letters to responsible Government bodies.[15]\r\nSeahorse beneath Edithburgh Jetty\r\nStriped Pyjama squid mating under Edithburgh jetty\r\nSeveral of the state\'s iconic marine species can be seen beneath or near the jetty, including the Leafy sea dragon and the Striped pyjama squid.[10][11]\r\nJetty pylons had been assessed some years prior by the State Government\'s Department of Transport, Energy and Infrastructure (now known as the Department of Planning, Transport and Infrastructure) and identified as a public liability risk.

The wider peninsula is shared by a combination of defence, industrial, residential, recreational and tourism interests. Port Bonython lies immediately to the north-west and is marked for future industrial expansion, driven by anticipated growth in the State\'s mining industry. The icons of the peninsula are the historic Point Lowly Lighthouse[3] and the mass breeding aggregation of Giant Australian Cuttlefish which occurs inshore each winter.\r\nThe Point Lowly peninsula is a low plateau, sloping NW - SE, in the Simmens quartzite member, of the Neoprotorozoic Tent Hill formation.

Mining commenced in 1900 and iron ore was transported by bullock wagon to Port Augusta then by rail to Port Pirie where it was used as a flux in the lead smelter there.[7][8] In 1901 a tramway from Iron Knob to Hummock Hill (later renamed Whyalla) was completed, followed by wharves in 1903. These allowed the direct loading of ships which could transport the ore across Spencer Gulf to Port Pirie.[7]\r\nShips operated by the then BHP company were similarly named Iron This and Iron That, some of which were built by the company at the Whyalla steelworks.\r\nIn 2010, Onesteel (now Arrium Ltd) announced that it would return to Iron Knob to reopen the Iron Monarch mine.[25] The Iron Monarch mine was prepared for reopening by Arrium Ltd in 2013.[27] As of 2015, both Iron Monarch and Iron Duke continue to produce iron ore for export and for smelting at the Whyalla steelworks.\r\nIn the early days of mining at Iron Knob, ironstone was carted by oxen to Hummock Hill (renamed Whyalla in 1914). Approximately 300 tonnes was delivered in a good week. Construction of a private railway greatly increased transportation rates and by 1939, 9,000 tonnes of ore was delivered daily to Whyalla by rail. Later trains carried 2000 ton loads.\r\nAdditional deposits of iron ore were developed by the Broken Hill Proprietary Company further south along the Middleback Range. These include Iron Baron, Iron Prince and Iron Queen (discovered in 1920) and Iron Knight, Iron Duchess and Iron Duke (discovered in 1934).[7]\r\nIron Knob\'s iron ore proved to be of such high quality (upwards of 60% purity) that it led to the development of the Australian steel industry. It supplied iron to Newcastle for and steel works established at Newcastle and Port Kembla in the 1910s and 1920s and Whyalla in the 1930s. The iron ore was transported by railway to Whyalla[9] where it was either smelted or dispatched by sea.\r\nIn 1937, output from the Middleback Range, mostly from Iron Monarch was estimated at 2 mtpa.[21] In 1939, it was referred to in England as the highest grade deposit of iron ore known in the world.[22] In 1943, the iron Knob deposit was still delivering an average ore grade of 64 percent metallic content.[23] In 1949, 99% of Australian demand for iron ore was met by supply from Iron Knob and associated mines in South Australia,[24] having risen from 95% in 1943.[23]\r\nIron Knob is a town in the Australian state of South Australia on the Eyre Peninsula immediately south of the Eyre Highway. At the 2006 census, Iron Knob and the surrounding area had a population of 199.[1] The town obtained its name from its proximity to large deposits of iron ore, most notably Iron Monarch which outcropped prominently from the relatively flat, surrounding landscape.\r\nIn the 1920s, iron ore from Iron Knob was exported to the Netherlands and the United States of America.[11] In the 1930s, customers included Germany and Great Britain.[12][13]\r\nQuarrying for iron at Iron Knob and Iron Monarch ended in 1998.[25] When the quarrying stopped, the town population reduced to 200[26] and Iron Knob was under threat of becoming a ghost town. However, due to rising prices of housing elsewhere, the town has attracted new residents seeking low cost residences. A home could be purchased for approximately A$35,000–70,000 and vacant land could be purchased for less than A$15,000.\r\nPrior to World War II, iron ore from Iron Knob was also exported to Japan.[14][15][16][17] In the financial year 1935-36, 291,961 tonnes of ore from Iron Knob was shipped there via the seaport of Whyalla.[18] This became a controversial matter in the late 1930s due in part to Australia\'s known reserves at the time being limited to Iron Knob and Yampi Sound in Western Australia. Japan was also considered an \'aggressor\' nation following acts of war against China in 1937.[19][20] Waterfront workers and seamen protested against the export of iron ore to Japan, leading to strikes and arrests.\r\n21% of the steel required for the construction of the Sydney Harbour Bridge[10] was quarried at Iron Knob and smelted at Port Kembla, New South Wales.

In the same year, the decision was finally made to alter the town\'s official name to \'Arno Bay\', named after a sandhill well and not the Italian \'Arno River\' as had been suggested.[2] The period of high export came to an abrupt end in 1963 when the storage silos were built, and ocean shipping became redundant to the large trucks that were now the main mechanism of transport.[3]\r\nThe area which is now known as Arno Bay was opened up by pastoralists in 1863, with the area being named \'Salt Creek Cove\' in these early days.[2] Of the variety of ventures that occurred before the town was built, the sinking of \'The Arno Bay Mine\' was possibly the least successful, with water halting all operations.[2] The small town was initially proclaimed in 1882 by G.

The area was serviced by a siding known simply as Terre Siding after one of the local properties. This was altered when the town was gazetted in February 1918, and named Lock after Corporal Albert Lock, a member of the South Australian Survey Department who had been killed in Belgium during World War I, in 1917.[2]\r\nAlthough many nearby coastal towns were settled much earlier, Lock was not established until the 1860s due to the low rainfall and marginal conditions. Early settlers grazed sheep on vast tracts of natural vegetation for very low costs. Land settlement occurred in 1861, with settlements continuing further north over the next decades.\r\nThe potential for wheat cropping was realised with the establishment of the railway, but the low rainfall kept any developments from happening until the pipeline from the Tod Reservoir was connected. Two years later, a huge underground water reservoir was discovered under the town, capable of supplying all of the town\'s water needs.[3]\r\nCoordinates: 33°34′S 135°46′E﻿ / ﻿33.567°S 135.767°E﻿ / -33.567; 135.767\r\nMining potential in the area is showing promise, with iron ore having been discovered in banded iron formations only 20 km to the southeast at Wilgerup by Centrex Metals Ltd.[6]\r\nIn the 2006 Australian Bureau of Statistics Census of Population and Housing, the population of the Lock town census area was 290.

A public school was constructed at Warramboo during early European settlement and remained a source of education for children of 5–12 years old from 1920 until its closure in 2002. The town hall was also constructed in the 1920s. The original wood and iron hall was demolished and a new stone hall constructed in its place in 1934.[8]\r\nThe traditional inhabitants of the Warramboo district and much of the South-West region of Eyre Peninsula are the Nawu/Nauo people. The word \'warramboo\' means \'a lake/place of water\', referring to the prevalence of samphire swamps in the region.[9]\r\nWarramboo (wɔrˑræmˑbʉː) is a locality in the Australian state of South Australia located on the Eyre Peninsula about 334 kilometres (208 mi) north-west of the state capital of Adelaide and about 26 kilometres (16 mi) south-east of the municipal seat of Wudinna.[2][3] It is also located 189 kilometres (117 mi) north of Port Lincoln on the Tod Highway and Port Lincoln-Thevenard branch of the Eyre Peninsula Railway.[7]\r\nThe Australian newspaper of 10 March 2014, pg 23, reports a new iron ore (Magnetite) proposal on the Eyre Peninsular. The mine is north of Lock, near Warramboo, with a new deep water port at Hardy Bay.[citation needed] The company concerned is Iron Road Limited.[citation needed] The mine is expected to have a 25-year life, at 20MTPA.[citation needed]\r\nThe agricultural economy of the region may expand to include iron ore mining in the near future, pending the development of Iron Road Ltd\'s Central Eyre Iron Project. The deposit is located between Warramboo and Lock, to the east of the Tod Highway.\r\nThe township of Warramboo has little in the way of services, with no shops or petrol stations. The local post office [Post Code; 5650] still services the local community.\r\nThe local Australian rules football team (Central Eyre Football Club) was formed from an amalgamation of the Warramboo and Kyancutta Football Clubs in 1986. The Central Eyre Football Club is one of 6 teams in the Mid West Football League.\r\nThe railway line was constructed from 1907-1915 C.E. to facilitate the development of the cereal industry on the Peninsula.[7] The grain silos remain a distinctive local landmark of the town today.

Barley and wheat farming take place alongside sheep grazing on the adjacent farmland. Marine activities include abalone diving, offshore abalone aquaculture, lobster and scale fisheries.\r\nThe Nauo people were hit extremely hard by the effects of European invasion. There was a very great deal of violence against Aboriginal people in this area (and a good deal of violence against white settlers also). The Waterloo Bay Massacre is thought to have occurred close to Elliston, and there is also a large number of better-documented murders and other violent acts towards Aboriginal people in this area.\r\nIn the 2006 Australian Bureau of Statistics Census of Population and Housing, the population of the Elliston town census area was 377 people. Males outnumbered females. 92.8% of the population was born in Australia, with immigrants coming from England, France, Germany, Papua New Guinea and the Republic of Korea.[1]\r\nThe Country Women’s Association Rooms were the first to be built in South Australia by that organisation and opened on 4 July 1936.\r\nChristianity is the most followed religion in the town with 51% of the town following the religion. The major denominations in the town are the Anglican, Catholic and Uniting churches. 29% of the town had no religious beliefs.[4]\r\nElliston has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:\r\nThe area is a tourist destination, the town having two caravan parks as well as motel and hotel accommodation. Fishing, swimming and other water based activities are common in the protected bay.\r\nInside the bay, it is relatively calm and shallow, with seagrass beds and reefs underwater, and sandy beaches lining most of the bay. Inland, the country is mostly flat agricultural land. The southern end of the Lake Newland Conservation Park lies about 10 km to the north of the town.\r\nIt has also been suggested that Jervois, who had a military background chose to honour Sir Henry Walton Ellis (1783–1815) who was a hero of the Battle of Waterloo during which campaign he died of his wounds. The area was settled in the 1840s with Elliston being the central port from which the early settlers transported their wool and wheat to market. Sailing ships and later steam ships crossed Waterloo Bay’s notorious reefed entrance. A number of ships foundered in the bay due to its narrow entrance and variable tides.\r\nSurfing is possible at stretches along the coast, but high numbers of sharks make it risky. Many surf beaches are known for catches of salmon, mulloway and shark as well, with Lock\'s Well one of the more established beaches.\r\nPort Adelaide Power footballer Cameron Hitchcock hails from Elliston.\r\nEdward John Eyre explored the area on land in 1840 and 1841 on a journey to Western Australia from Port Lincoln. Originally named Waterloo Bay, the township was later named by Governor Sir William Jervois on a plan for the town on 23 November 1878. Locally it is believed to be named after the writer and educator Ellen Liston who was born in England in 1838 and emigrated to South Australia in 1850. She was a governess working on a local property (Nilkerloo) owned by John Hamp.\r\nThe first inhabitants of the land that is now Elliston were the Nauo people.\r\nThe first District Council of Elliston Council Chambers were built in 1913 and still stand adjacent to Waterloo Bay Caravan Park.\r\nOffshore, Flinders Island is 55 km away from the mainland.\r\nElliston is a small coastal town in the Australian state of South Australia on the west coast of Eyre Peninsula 169 km northwest of Port Lincoln and 641 km west of Adelaide. The township is located on Waterloo Bay. It has a rainfall of 426 mm per annum.[3] At the 2006 census, Elliston had a population of 377.[4]\r\nThe town has a number of sporting clubs and facilities, as well as churches, hotels and a large number of local businesses.\r\nThe first recorded exploration of the adjacent coastline was by Matthew Flinders in the vessel HMS Investigator from 10–13 February 1802. He named the offshore islands but did not note the presence of Waterloo Bay in his log.\r\nThe Post Office was opened on 13 August 1880 and is the oldest public building still in use. The first Police Station (which still stands) was opened in 1881 and continued in use until 1971.\r\nThe hall, which was officially opened on 10 February 1968, is distinguished by its mural which was painted with the help of local community members under the direction of artists Siv Grava and John Turpie. According to the placard erected by the District Council of Elliston, it is the largest mural of its type in Australia, depicts the historical life of Elliston and covers more than 500 square metres in area.\r\nThe town of Elliston lies on Waterloo Bay, a small coastal inlet which is partially protected by a number of reefs lining the entrance to the bay.

But the town was pivotal in handling the grain and wool which was produced in the hinterland, with grain still being shipped from Port Kenny until the 2000s.[2]\r\nThe town features a base to which other destinations can be visited. The town jetty and surrounding waters are also known for their fishing potential, with whiting, flathead, trevally and garfish commonly caught.[3]\r\nPort Kenny lies on Venus Bay, a highly protected body of water characterised by tidal flats, mangrove swamps, small islands and shallow beaches. Nearby town Venus Bay lies close to the entrance of the bay, while Port Kenny lies on the northernmost side of the bay. The land around the town is relatively flat, and used primarily for agriculture.\r\nAs early as the late 1920s, the area was recognised as a recreational fishing destination, with anglers travelling to the tiny outposts to catch trevally and salmon.\r\nAgriculture is the towns main economic input, with cereal crops and livestock commonly farmed. Tourism supplements this, with the aid of the town hotel and caravan park.\r\nPort Kenny is a small town located on the Eyre Peninsula in South Australia.

The bay is shielded from ocean swells by a small promenade of land that leads to Point Brown. Around 10 km offshore lies \'Eyre Island\', a small, sandy island that also protects the bay.[11]\r\nSmoky Bay is accessed from the Flinders Highway, which runs along the coast of the Peninsula. Stateliner bus services also run buses to the town, with the town\'s station located opposite the general store.[16]\r\nSurrounding the bay is a mixture of mangroves to the south and coastal sand dune vegetation to the north. The mangroves tend to give the water in some parts of the bay a yellow stain, presumed to be from tannins and decaying leaf matter.\r\nThere is a sporting club north of the caravan park with an oval and tennis courts. The club serves meals and is open to the general public.[15]\r\nThe town has long since ceased function as a port, but since 1988 has experienced a surge in the aquaculture of oysters. The initial area allocation was of 85 ha within Smoky Bay, with individual farms having a maximum size of 10 ha. This has since been increased to 165 ha (including 40 ha of subtidal or deepwater culture). Smoky Bay oysters are well recognized within South Australia, along with other producers such as Coffin Bay.[9]\r\nInside the bay, the calm waters are dominated by shallow stretches of seagrass, sandflats, mudflats, as well as numerous channels or \'creeks\' that allow boat access, with slightly deeper water.[12]\r\nIn the early 1900s the town area was opened up, with the first building a tin hut erected in 1905. Scrubcutters cleared the area by 1906, and by 1911 a post office, repeating station and living quarters had been built. The town continued to grow, with a school and hall opened in 1909. A jetty was proposed for erection in 1908, and finally completed in 1913.[4]\r\nTourism has been a rapidly expanding sector of the town\'s economy, with a caravan park and numerous beach side shacks established. Recreational fishing is the largest draw to the town, with the jetty and boat ramp heavily used in the summer holidays. Other water based sports such as swimming and snorkelling are popular, with a large shark proof cage constructed on the side of the jetty. Swimming outside of this enclosure can be risky, as evident by a recent death caused by a large shark in the bay.[13]\r\nIn the early 1860s pastoralists arrived in the district. Former Adelaide civil servant Charles Francis Heath (1832–83) established a sheep grazing property which he named Wallanippie Station after the Aboriginal name of a waterhole near his homestead at the back of Point Brown promontry.\r\nThe bay is home to a large variety of seabirds, as well as many fish species, including Great White Sharks, which are frequent visitors from the offshore islands. Seals also enter the bay, providing further incentive for sharks to enter the bay.[13]\r\nMarilyns Country Music Festival is a unique annual event held in Smoky Bay, It is the only music event in the world using an Oyster Barge as a stage, Held in September this event attracts artists and patrons from all over Australia\r\nDuring the 2002/2003 summer, a ban on taking all shellfish from the waters of the bay was imposed after a deadly biotoxin was discovered in the shellfish.[10]\r\nThe local oyster industry has been the source of tourist attractions also, with guided tours now established.\r\nThe town itself is situated on a long, sandy beach that ends at the boat ramp. Inland is dominated by agricultural land, used for cropping and grazing of sheep.\r\nOffshore lie a number of small, granitic islands which are home to many seabirds and tiger snakes that feed on the birds. The Nuyts Archipelago lies to the west, the islands of which are not easily accessible.\r\nThe Streaky Bay and Ceduna airfields also offer flights to the area, however another form of transport must be found to get down to Smoky Bay.\r\nThere is a single church, of the Uniting denomination opposite the caravan park. The town has a recently constructed boat ramp with a fee payable to Ceduna Council for its use. The old jetty, which has been shortened due to storm damage still stands, with the remnants of the original structure still standing off the end of the jetty.\r\nSmoky Bay (formerly Wallanippie) is a small coastal village located in South Australia on the west coast of the Eyre Peninsula. Previously used as a port, the town is now a residential settlement and popular tourist destination known for its recreational fishing, with a boat ramp and jetty located in the town. At the 2006 census, Smoky Bay had a population of 577.[1]\r\nThe town has around 200 permanent residents, with that number swelling to around 1000 in the peak summer months.

It was opened in 2011.[6] In February 2010 Premier Rann opened the world\'s largest mineral sands mine operated by Iluka Resources. The $390 million mine is located 200 km North West of Ceduna.[7]\r\nThe two schools in Ceduna are Crossways Lutheran School and Ceduna Area School (CAS).[10] Crossways has around 150 students from Reception to Year 10, of which approximately 80% are Indigenous. CAS has approximately 600 students, from Reception to Year 12, with approximately 25% of Indigenous students.\r\nCeduna has a radio telescope that is integrated into the CSIRO radio telescope network. Telstra donated the dish to the University of Tasmania in 1996 for use as a radio astronomy observatory. It is still in active use.[13]\r\nCeduna is also a hub for research on southern bluefin tuna.\r\nThe town is the last major settlement before crossing the Nullarbor Plain from east to west. It is set on Murat Bay and the sandy coves, sheltered bays and offshore islands of the bay make it a popular base for a beach holiday. The foreshore at Ceduna is lined with Norfolk Island pine trees. There is a jetty for walking, fishing and small boats.\r\nThere was a whaling station on nearby St Peter Island during the 1850s before settlement.\r\nMatthew Flinders on his voyage in the Investigator, anchored in Fowlers Bay on 28 January 1802. He went on to explore the coast and named Denial Bay, Smoky Bay and the islands of Nuyts Archipelago. He was disappointed to find no river and gave the name Denial Bay because they did not find fresh water. French expedition leader Nicolas Baudin discovered Murat Bay after meeting with Flinders and named it after Joachim Murat. He also named the point of Thevenard after the Admiral and Minister of Marine Antoine-Jean-Marie Thevenard, and Decres Bay after Denis Decres, duke of the First French Empire\r\nThe Commissioner of Crown Lands, faced with widespread agitation to open West Coast lands for agricultural settlement, invited three farmers in July 1887 to inspect the lands between Streaky Bay and Western Australia. They were optimistic about the area and recommended that the necessary surveys be started at once. In 1889 the Government in Adelaide formalised the Far West with survey lines.\r\nCeduna has a number of Indigenous homelands situated within 20–30 minutes of the town. These are groupings of Indigenous families who have chosen to live together. The council area has the highest percentage of Aboriginal people of all local government areas in South Australia, with the population currently standing at 24.8% (911) of the population.[9] A number of Aboriginal communities in adjacent unincorporated areas rely on the available services in Ceduna and use the town as a base for a variety of reasons.[9]\r\nCeduna was the site of a major satellite telecommunications facility operated by the Overseas Telecommunications Commission. It was a major employer in the town until made redundant by technological change. It was built in 1969 and by 1984 almost half of Australia\'s International telecommunication traffic passed through Ceduna\'s Earth Station.[5]\r\nThe Thevenard port of Ceduna is a high-frequency deep sea port which exports grain, salt, mineral sand and gypsum, all which are found within the local region.\r\nCeduna is a town in South Australia located on the shores of Murat Bay on the west coast of Eyre Peninsula. It lies west of the junction of the Flinders and Eyre Highways around 786 km northwest of the capital Adelaide. The port town/suburb of Thevenard lies 3 km to the west on Cape Thevenard. It is in the District Council of Ceduna, the federal Division of Grey, and the state electoral district of Flinders. The name Ceduna is a corruption of the local Aboriginal word Chedoona and is said to mean a place to sit down and rest. The town has played an important but minor role in Australia\'s overall development due to it being a fishing port and a railway hub.\r\nThe Tod Water pipeline was officially opened by Mr M McIntosh, Commissioner of Public Works, June 1928.\r\nAquaculture remains a major industry in',0,-32.126082,133.675174),(13062,'Charra','5690','Eyre Peninsula and South West','South Australia - Outback','SA','Not yet populated',0,-32.053275,133.331733),(13063,'Coorabie','5690','Eyre Peninsula and South West','South Australia - Outback','SA','Coorabie is a settlement in South Australia.[4] It is outside of district council boundaries, and therefore managed by the Outback Communities Authority.

The first service was held on 8 March 1903 led by Rev J.B.Smellie who renovated it to suit. An extra room accessed through the former double doors was added when the building was thoroughly renovated and the exterior rendered in 1918 during the term of Rev H.E. Carey. The extension was removed in 1955 when AIM Patrol Padre 1949-57 Vic Murrell lived in Beltana in the original manse. The building has been kept in fair condition and with much local and other support was put in good order for the commemoration of the founding of the Australian Inland Mission held there 6/7 October 2012.\r\nThe area was first established for pastoralism by John Haimes in 1854 and then surveyed by John McDouall Stuart in 1855.[16] In 1862 the property was acquired by Robert Barr Smith along with the flock of 17,705 sheep that the property was supporting.[18]\r\nThe town has had horse racing since 1876, and the annual picnic races and gymkhana and biennial pastoral field day are still continued.[4] There are services and accommodation available at Beltana station and there is an interpretive history trail and self-guided tour around the town. The Beltana roadhouse, now 12 km from Beltana on the main highway between Parachilna and Leigh Creek, acted as the town\'s local store until it closed in 2016.\r\nThe town was, for some time, the starting point of many central Australian expeditions and explorations including those by Ernest Giles in 1872, Peter Warburton in 1873, Ross in 1874, Lewis in 1874-75, and Lawrence Wells in 1883.[6]\r\nSaltbush, bluebush and other acacias are native plants that, with the reduction in stocking over the last decades of the 20th century, are beginning to return to the town area. River red gums line the creeks and there is a nearby yellow-footed rock-wallaby population.\r\nThe original inhabitants were the Adnyamathanha Aboriginal people who used the area as a camp due to the nearby springs. With the arrival of Europeans their traditional lifestyle was disrupted and many of them began working as stockmen on pastoral runs.[2] During the early years of European settlement they kept a camp near Beltana Station but later moved closer to the town at Warrioota Creek. As the town was gradually depopulated some Aboriginal people occupied the abandoned buildings so by the late 1960s they again formed the majority of the population.[5]\r\nA temporary repeater station was opened in 1872 followed by a permanent station in 1875. Operated by a staff of up to six it relayed morse telegraph messages on the Port Darwin-Adelaide telegraph lines. The station received its first phone message in 1878, was moved in 1940 to a telephone switchboard at the local shop, and closed by 1956 as an automatic exchange had been installed.[2]\r\nThomas Elder took over lease no. 370 in 1862 forming Beltana Station and until the early 20th century there were as many as 60 living on the station.[2] Beltana Pastoral run for many years was the head station of the Beltana Pastoral Co. The station ran livestock, and a camel breeding programme for work on the telegraph, exploring and its own use.[4]\r\nRev Fred H. Patterson [1888–1944] supplied part-time in 1932 while minister of Port Augusta. From the beginning of 1933 the Mission was absorbed into the Southern Patrol of the Australian Inland Mission with Patterson padre 1933-40.\r\nBeltana has important links with the overland telegraph, transcontinental railway, mining, outback services, Australian Inland Mission and also has Afghan sites relating to its past as a camel-based transport centre.[3]\r\nMechanisation, mine closure, drought and depression lead to the slow decline of Beltana as a service centre for the region from 1920 onwards. The railway realignment consequent to gauge change in 1956 and road movement in 1983 completed the reversal of the town\'s fortune.[15]\r\nMissioners were to be ordained ministers, but several who served were not. The Smith of Dunesk missioners until the Mission was absorbed into the AIM as the Southern Patrol in 1933 were:\r\nOn 19 January 1878 Sir William Jervois symbolically turned the first sod on the new northern railway (called The Ghan) at Port Augusta.

One meal is a roast prepared using a camp oven on a bed of coals. This annual event attracts over 500 people to the town, who can be found camping throughout the area. It attracts many people from Adelaide, South Australia and is the biggest event on the town\'s calendar, bringing in much-needed tourist money to the area. Each team\'s cooking is usually judged by a group of local celebrities and there is $3,000 prize for the winning team. This event is run by the Blinman Hotel.[13]\r\nFamily life was hard in the early days. Both water and firewood had to be brought from long distances from the mine. This job was left to the women and their elder children while the men were working. Many pregnancies failed in the early years and there were several deaths reported from inflammation of the lungs. With the original tent settlement being very close to the mine, it was very hard to escape the fine dust generated. A hotel and post office were first opened in Blinman in 1863. In 1864, a government surveyor laid out 162 allotments about three km from the mine. This was named Blinman. The population was about 1,500 by 1868 and the first school opened that year. Decent shops in the main street developed in 1869. The striking of regular water in the mine the same year secured a regular water supply for the town.\r\nThis event was a meeting place for Land Rover enthusiasts from around Australia organized by the Land Rover Register of South Australia, There are competitions, tag-a-long tours and parties. Competitions include non timed trial course and \'Best of Breed\' car judging. In 2012 the event moved to Melrose South Australia.[12]\r\nThe two most popular events in the town are a Land Rover jamboree held over the Easter long weekend and Cook Out Back. Both events are held during the Australian winter because of the searing heat during summer.[citation needed]\r\nThe town itself boasts a pub, general store, a church and a cafe/gallery. There are tennis courts, a golf course and a cricket pitch, though they see sporadic use. Fuel is not available.[citation needed]\r\nTourists travel to this area to enjoy the Outback of South Australia and to see the ancient geology of the area. The town is close to Brachina Gorge and Parachilna Gorge. These two rarely have flowing water in them. Also nearby are the Blinman Pools. The town is a stop off on the way to Arkaroola. The copper mine at one end of the town is another attraction.[citation needed]\r\nBlinman is a town deep in the Flinders Ranges, in the mid north of South Australia. It is very small but has the claim of being the highest surveyed town in South Australia.[3] It serves as a base for large acre pastoralists and tourism. The town is just north of the Flinders Ranges National Park, is 60 kilometres(km) north of Wilpena Pound and 485 km north of Adelaide.\r\nMining was successful in the first year and the mine became known as Wheal Blinman. The original four leaseholders sold their mine in February 1862, for about 150 times the purchase price. The new owners were the Yudnamutana Copper Mining Company of South Australia, who also owned a rich deposit north of Blinman. The mine was very successful during the 1860s and the site became permanent, with buildings being constructed and more miners moving to the area, some from the Burra mine. The hardest problems at the time were the transport of Ore and the finding of water. Over the next 20 years, railways were developed and wells were sunk at regular intervals making life easier for all.\r\nThis town, like many remote towns in South Australia is not part of a local government area but receives services from the Outback Communities Authority.[3] It is part of the Stuart state electoral district[14] and the state representative is Dan van Holst Pellekaan. The national representative is Rowan Ramsey who is elected to the Grey federal electorate.[15]\r\nBlinman has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:\r\nMining continued until 1918 when the ore ran out. The busiest time for the mine was 1913-1918 with a town population of 2,000. The total ore removed was about 10,000 tonnes.[5]\r\nThe first European settlement around the current Blinman, was firstly of Angorichina Station. This land was taken up for sheep farming in the 1850s. A shepherd employed by the station, Robert Blinman, discovered a copper outcrop on a hot December day in 1859. Blinman gambled some of his money on the presence of more underground copper and received a mineral application in 1860. On 1 January 1861, Blinman and three friends, Alfred Frost, Joe Mole and Henry Alfred, received the lease for the land that became Blinman.[4]\r\nThis land belonged to the Adnyamathanha tribe, of Indigenous Australians prior to Europeans. They were stone age hunter-gatherers and inhabited much of the area (including Wilpena Pound to the south and other areas to the north).

Away from the highway, the hotel fronts the railway line and the now derelict station building. The old hotel has been in part retained, in part restored and tastefully extended. There are now no passengers on the line that once ran from Adelaide to Marree and connected with the old Ghan line to Oodnadatta and Alice Springs. The hotel\'s patrons all come by car or bus and find their way in from the highway. The grand old sandstone and limestone building is now replete with fully modern amenities; amenities that are not so frequent in places further north. Local aboriginal artwork decorates the lounges and dining room and there are displays of the nearby Ediacaran fossils, relicts of great significance to the fossil community. Apart from the hotel itself, there are \'spill-over\' facilities available across the road, by the railway line, varying from self-contained cabins to Atcos and camping areas.[citation needed]\r\nThe outstanding feature of establishment is the dining room menu and the \'feral feast\' on offer. Camel mettwurst and camel sausage; goat and goat cheese and feral pork form a feral platter available as an antipasto or main meal. Kangaroo and emu, although not feral, are also on the menu, with smoked roo, roo fillet and emu pâté on offer.\r\nParachilna is a country town in South Australia. The town was first surveyed in 1863 due to its closeness to a government water well.[2] It is on the railway line and road between Port Augusta and Leigh Creek. Today, the Prairie Hotel, railway station, airstrip and a few buildings remain. The road east into the Flinders Ranges leads through Parachilna Gorge, recognised for its scenic beauty, to Blinman. The town is surrounded by Motpena station pastoral lease.[3]\r\nThe historic Parachilna Fettlers\' Cottages Ruins are listed on the South Australian Heritage Register.[6]\r\nThe town\'s name is from the Aboriginal patajilnda, meaning \"place of peppermint gum trees\"\"\"\". The spelling difference is due to an early translation misreading.[4] The railway station was completed in 1881 as part of the line to Leigh Creek through Beltana.[5] The area was one of the set locations for the Australian feature film\"',0,-31.133078,138.399654),(13107,'Coopers Creek','5731','Outback - North and East','South Australia - Outback','SA','Not yet populated',0,-27.800455,140.619083),(13108,'Cordillo Downs','5731','Outback - North and East','South Australia - Outback','SA','Not yet populated',0,-26.706902,140.623062),(13109,'Durham Downs','5731','Outback - North and East','South Australia - Outback','SA','Not yet populated',0,-27.076424,141.905477),(13110,'Innamincka','5731','Outback - North and East','South Australia - Outback','SA','Not yet populated',0,-27.745993,140.736501),(13112,'Lyndhurst','5731','Outback - North and East','South Australia - Outback','SA','Lyndhurst is a town in north-east South Australia which is at the crossroads of the Strzelecki Track and the Oodnadatta Track.

Mount Lyndhurst, 30 km east, was named after the British Lord Chancellor by the government surveyor Samuel Perry. In the 1860s, Thomas Elder took up vast areas in the northern Flinders region and called the property Mount Lyndhurst.[citation needed]\r\nThe original inhabitants were the aboriginal nation of the Yantruwanta. The town is at the southern end of the Strzelecki Track, whose northern end is at Innamincka. It was once a station on the original train route north known as the Great Northern Railway that was planned to reach Darwin, but only ever made it to Alice Springs. This railway line became known as the Ghan, and the last train ran along it in 1980. The route was always subject to the weather and wash outs, and a more permanent route has been constructed some 200 km to the west, and subsequently extended to Darwin in 2003. 80 km to the north is Marree, a small town that is at the junction of the Oodnadatta and Birdsville Tracks.[citation needed]\r\n',0,-30.287589,138.349417),(13113,'Merty Merty','5731','Outback -

It was one of the earliest wrecks of a European ship on Australian shores. In 1972, a full expedition was mounted to systematically explore the remains of the ship and its fittings. Damage by looters had left little intact, but over several months a quantity of artefacts was recovered, which are now displayed at maritime museums in Geraldton and Fremantle.\r\nThe town\'s name originates from the nearby coastal feature of the same name, a series of rocky ledges on the point that was first described in an 1875 hydrographic survey. The Gingin Road Board requested that land be set aside in the area in 1937 for camping and recreation purposes. In 1952 there were three squatters\' shacks that had been built in the reserve and once a road was completed into the area in 1953 more people began to request land leases. The government decided to subdivide the area in 1954 and sell blocks for retirees and holiday housing. The town was gazetted in 1955.[2]\r\nThe area is also known for the 1983 wreck of the Jackup oil drilling rig Key Biscayne, which toppled over in storms about 10 nautical miles (19 km) offshore whilst under tow.\r\nLedge Point is a small coastal township 105 km north of Perth, Western Australia.

Bailup Road links Bailup to Wooroloo further south.[5] No public transport is available.\r\nBailup was named after a nearby creek and a police station and inn established on Toodyay Road in the 1840s. The name is of Noongar origin but its meaning is unclear.[1] The name was approved in early 1999 by the Department of Land Administration.[2]\r\nMost of the locality is covered in open Jarrah, marri and wandoo woodland, with some areas of dense understorey vegetation. Nearby Morangup Hill ( WikiMiniAtlas31°39′31″S 116°18′55″E﻿ / ﻿31.65861°S 116.31528°E﻿ / -31.65861; 116.31528), the main feature of a reserve managed by the Department of Environment and Conservation (DEC) on the edge of the Avon Valley National Park, is a granite peak providing extensive views over the surrounding area and is home to several species of birds including the square-tailed kite.[3] The Red Swamp Brook, which runs through Bailup, feeds a significant wetland area.\r\nMorangup Estate, the main residential area, is located just to the north of Toodyay Road on the east bank of the Red Swamp Brook, and contains about 200 residents and a small commercial centre. Some hobby farms have been established on nearby cleared land. Plans to build a new estate 2 km south within the Mundaring boundary were submitted in 2004, with Mundaring council approving the rezoning at its June meeting.[4]\r\nBailup is a Western Australian locality and rural residential estate located 62 kilometres (39 mi) north-east of the state capital, Perth, along Toodyay Road.

The most significant development occurred from the 1970s, with further population growth in the early 1990s.\r\nRegarding the origin of the name, the Western Australian Department of Land Information states:[2]\r\nBullsbrook (Formerly Bullsbrook East) is a suburb of Perth, Western Australia in the outer metropolitan area. It is located in the City of Swan. The original Bullsbrook townsite is located slightly west of the current town, on the 17 km mark of the Midland Railway. Bullsbrook is also the home to the RAAF Pearce airbase, a major training facility for the Royal Australian Air Force. The suburb is situated on the Great Northern Highway, 25 kilometres north of the Midland Strategic Regional Centre. It is well serviced by several major transport networks including the Great Northern Highway, Railway Parade and the Brand Highway to the north, Chittering Road to the east and Neaves Road to the west. Bullsbrook is also adjacent to the State rail network, providing an opportunity for the development of an intermodal freight transport hub. The site is further strengthened by linkage to the planned Perth-Darwin National Highway via Stock Road.\r\nAlthough traditionally a predominantly rural suburb, the release in 2008 of the Bullsbrook Commercial Centre offers great scope for expansion in the commercial and light industrial land use capability of Bullsbrook. In addition, the City of Swan is awaiting the State\'s approval of the draft Bullsbrook Townsite and Rural Strategy which would see further industrial, commercial and residential growth in Bullsbrook.\r\n',0,-31.670853,116.031245),(13326,'Chittering','6084','Swan','Perth - North East','WA','Chittering is a town and rural district approximately 70 km NNE of Perth, Western Australia.

This route services the Baldivis Town Centre during business hours, travelling through Settlers Hills via Arpentuer Drive through Evermore Heights, The Ridge and Terminate in The Dales (Smirk Road). Route 567 services The Rivergums and Heritage Park. It also connects the Baldivis community with a regular service to the Baldivis Town Centre. Both routes run 7 days a week running every 30 minutes and every 10 minutes in peak hours. Route 568 services Baldivis Central and the newly developed Town Side estate and Retirement village. Route 565 services through newly established Baldivis Quarter.\r\nThe name of Baldivis was thought up by settlers in the area who were attracted to the region by the 1920s Group Settlement Scheme. The name derives from three ships which travelled to Western Australia in 1922, all within six weeks of each other, bring settlers under the scheme. They were named BALranald, DIogenes and the JerVIS Bay. It was the maiden voyage for all three ships and they were all built in the same shipyard in the same year.[2]\r\nHousing estates in the suburb include Tuart Ridge, Settlers Hills, Settlers Townside, The Rivergums, Baldivis Central, Baldivis North, The Chimes, Brightwood, Evermore Heights, The Ridge, The Chase, Highbury Park, Heritage Park, The Dales, Avalon, Woodleigh Grove, Sherwood and Parkland Heights.\r\nThe Kwinana Freeway runs through Baldivis, providing vehicle access to Perth and Bunbury. Safety Bay Road links Baldivis with neighbouring suburbs to the west like Rockingham and Warnbro.\r\nMany of the road names in Baldivis (e.g. Sixty Eight Road, Fifty Road, etc.) originate from the group numbers.\r\nThe western half of Baldivis (generally west of Baldivis Road) is composed of undulating sand and limestone soil with occasional wetlands. The high point is known as Tamworth Hill, which is the site of a water reservoir. Much of this land has been developed for residential use. East of Baldivis Road the land is generally flat and comprises sand and clay soils; the exception being the sandy hill known as Dog Hill. These areas are generally used for rural purposes. The western portion of Baldivis contains tuart trees; some of the trees have been retained within the residential areas.\r\nLand parallel to the eastern side of Baldivis Road was set aside for a tramway between Jandakot in the north and Karnup to the south, to provide access to the Group Settlement Scheme land. Although part of the tramway was constructed, it was never constructed in Baldivis. The tramway reserve is retained for open space.\r\nBaldivis is a semi-rural residential suburb 46 kilometres (29 mi) south of the central business district of Perth, the capital of Western Australia, and 11 kilometres (6.8 mi) southeast of the regional centre of Rockingham. It is located with the City of Rockingham local government area.\r\nThe main shopping facilities in Baldivis are located in the area known as the Baldivis Town Centre, on Settlers Avenue, and includes the Baldivis Shopping Centre (opened in mid-2007) owned by Stockland. Extensions completed in 2015 expanded the existing Shopping Centre to include a Food Court/Restaurant precinct, increased car park numbers and a Woolworths.\r\nThe principal shared path along the Kwinana Freeway provides bicycle access to Perth.\r\nLand in the western portion of Baldivis was zoned for urban development in the 1990s, and the suburb has been progressively developed for residential.

However, dissension within the board during the 1950s saw it suspended and Commissioner Richard Rushton oversaw the town\'s affairs. On 26 April 1960, the Mandurah Road Board was reconstituted, and on 1 July 1961, in accordance with the Local Government Act 1960, the Shire of Mandurah was founded.\r\nMost of the city is governed by the City of Mandurah, although a couple of suburbs east of the Serpentine River are governed by the Shire of Murray.\r\nMandurah was featured in the 1986 film Windrider, starring Nicole Kidman.\r\nThe Mandurah area boasts family friendly beaches such as Doddis Beach, Blue Bay and Mandurah Beach and surf beaches around Wannanup and Dawesville such as Avalon, 4th Groyne, Giri\'s, Pyramids and The Wedge.\r\nIndustrial development at Kwinana(1955),[12] a mining boom in nearby Jarrahdale (1963)[13] and Wagerup (1984),[14] with the associated industrial boom in Pinjarra (1963),[15] combined with an idyllic lifestyle by the coast, saw Mandurah grow rapidly, and on 1 July 1987 it was upgraded to the Town of Mandurah. Three years later, on 14 April 1990, Mandurah became the fifth non-metropolitan settlement in Western Australia to become a city.[16]\r\nTwo zoos lie within the outskirts of the city, as well as a miniature village, a tourist railway and a national park.\r\nPublic transport in Mandurah is covered by Transperth due to its proximity to Perth itself, with eleven bus routes servicing the city while the Mandurah railway line, opened in December 2007, links Mandurah to Perth via Mandurah railway station with a travel time of approximately 50 minutes. Mandurah is also a stop on Transwa bus services between Perth and the South West.\r\nMandurah (/ˈmændʒərə/ or /ˈmændʒrə/) is the second-largest city in Western Australia, located approximately 72 kilometres (45 mi) south of the state capital, Perth.\r\nMandurah is home to the Peel Thunder Football Club in the West Australian Football League, Mandurah City in the Football West State League and the Pirates Rugby Union club in the RugbyWA competition. Greyhound racing is held weekly at the Greyhounds WA Mandurah venue.[21] Mandurah also hosts an SBL (State Basketball League) team called Mandurah Magic.\r\nMandurah has also become a popular lifestyle alternative for Perth retirees and its connection with the Perth CBD has been strengthened with the opening of the Perth-Mandurah railway line in December 2007 and a direct road connection to the Kwinana Freeway built by late 2010. A housing affordability survey of 227 cities in 2008 ranked it the least affordable city in Australia.[3]\r\nLike neighbouring settlements Bunbury and Rockingham dolphins and whales frequent the city annually and dolphin and whale watching are a popular pastime. In December, the canal areas in Mandurah becomes well known for their Christmas lights and special boat cruises are often promoted as a result.\r\nMandurah is located in the Swan Coastal Plain ecoregion. The ecoregion contains an array of vegetation, from coastal dune and sandplains to banksia and eucalypt woodlands. Mandurah is covered by shoreline and dune deposits from the Pleistocene and Holocene that overlie Paleozoic and Neogene deposits of the Perth Basin. Coastal dunes feature scrub-heath communities, though banksia low woodlands occur on the soils of coastal dunes. Progressing inland give way to eucalypt woodlands.[4]\r\nTwo local newspapers service the city, the weekly Mandurah Coastal Times and the Mandurah Mail.[19]\r\nThe population of the town was 160 (95 males and 65 females) in 1898.[11]\r\nThe waters of the Peel Inlet and Harvey Estuary (one of Australia\'s larger inlet systems) form the centre of Mandurah. The estuary is approximately twice the size of Sydney Harbour. The city lies in and around this freshwater system which in turn feeds into the Indian Ocean. The city and its suburbs have many kilometres of ocean coastline most of which is sandy beaches. Mandurah also has a number of suburbs built around artificially created canal systems that extend from the Peel Inlet, such as Halls Head, Dudley Park and Wannanup.\r\nMandurah lies at the southern end of the Perth TV licence area, and is close to the regional Western Australia licence area. Local translators provide five digital free to air networks from Perth: ABC, Seven, Nine, Ten and SBS and three networks from southern Western Australia: SSW, WIN and SDW.

A railway from Asquith Block was completed in 1948 (including a 28-span timber trestle bridge which is now heritage listed). In the early 1950s, Asquith logs were brought to Banksiadale by G class locomotives (later replaced by more modern and powerful Cs class) and the sawn timber was returned to Dwellingup.[2]\r\nBy 1917, a network of railways covering 33 km of track extended from Banksiadale to the areas in which timber was being felled. In the year of 1926 alone, the Banksiadale mill produced 185,000 sleepers, and 6,347 other loads, of which the WAGR utilised a little more than 50%, the balance being sold or stacked.[1]\r\nThe Hotham Valley railway (operated by WAGR) was opened from Pinjarra to Dwellingup in 1910 to access the jarrah and marri timber in the area. In 1911, a site to produce timber for a wide range of general railway purposes was selected 8 km north of Dwellingup and a railway was opened to it in January 1912. The No. 2 Railway Mill was built in the same year and began operations in December 1912.\r\nThe Dwellingup fires in January and February 1961 devastated the countryside but the Banksiadale townsite and timber mill escaped damage. The mill only, was burnt down in 1963 and was not rebuilt as it was on land destined to be flooded when the South Dandalup Dam was constructed. Many of the mill houses were transferred to the Dwellingup townsite and private homes were sold to be demolished. Railways were subsequently removed, but ARHS special excursion trains took visitors into the area in the 1960s.\r\nBanksiadale is named after the plant genus Banksia, as the area consists of jarrah forest with unusually thick understorey of Banksia grandis (Bull Banksia).

The Great Depression also saw many mill hands leave the area as wages were not covering food and other necessities. In 1941, the original mill burnt down, and a new, smaller mill requiring only 16 workers was built. At the time of the fires, Nanga Brook was already in trouble, unable to compete with the Dwellingup mill.\r\nThe area was home to a milling town that operated from about 1900 until the Dwellingup fires of 1961. Timber was taken from the area as early as 1898, and in 1902 a lease was granted to Yarloop-based Millars Karri & Jarrah Company (formerly Millar Brothers). The Nanga Mill was the biggest in the area for many years, at times employing over 100 men. In 1909 a townsite was laid out and built by Millars, complete with 56 homes and several other lodgings, a store, butcher, hall, billiard room and school. Later, three tennis courts and a sports oval were added.\r\nThe Lane-Poole Reserve (named after one of the State\'s early Conservator of Forests) is a 55,000 ha forest reserve with stands of jarrah, wandoo, marri and blackbutt. It combined six previous reserves and was gazetted in 1984, with a management plan being approved in 1990 The most popular parts of the reserve are those near to the Murray River, one of the few undammed rivers in this part of Western Australia with natural waterfalls and rock pools along its length. The most popular campsites are Baden Powell, Nanga Mill, Stringers and Charlie\'s Flat, followed by Tony\'s Bend and Yarragil, while Icy Creek Environmental Education Camp (built in 1984) offers built accommodation for students and community groups. Only one or two roads in the area are sealed, and a CALM issues paper has identified this as a matter to be rectified, along with the overuse of non-designated campsites, visitor behaviour and safety, dogs in the reserve and firewood collection.[3]\r\nThe fires in January and February 1961 incinerated the entire town and devastated the countryside. A massive appeal was mounted through Perth and eastern states newspapers by the Australian Red Cross and other charities meeting with a generous response, which ensured the workers and their families were able to rebuild their lives.

Roe spoke highly of the area and its potential value for agriculture. The first pastoralists and shepherds arrived in the area in the 1880s seeking improved pasture for their stock.\r\nA school was established in 1903, and in 1916 a private subdivision was undertaken surrounding the schoolsite.

At the 2011 census, Roelands had a population of 620.[1]\r\nIn 1893 a railway station was built here to service the railway line from Pinjarra to Picton Junction, and was initially called Collie Siding after the nearby Collie River. However, after the gazettal of nearby Collie in December 1897, and much public argument in the region, Collie Siding was renamed to Roelands. The first big quantity of coal from Collie was carted by road to the Collie Siding and then railed to Perth. The demand on the area from the timber and coal business led to the construction of the Colliefields Hotel.\r\nFrom the 1940s until the 1970s the Roelands Farm and Mission housed Aboriginal children who had been removed from their families. Harry Lupton (UAM) and Ken Cross started it. UAM and later Churches of Christ missionaries served here.

The line was completed in 1910 and the Dinninup station was opened at the same time. The town was gazetted in 1915.[1]\r\nDinninup is a small town in the South West region of Western Australia.

A 2004 assessment by Wesfarmers showed arsenic contamination in and surrounding a drainage channel to Lefroy Brook.[6][7] The WA government accepted responsibility for the issue, as State Saw Mills used arsenic to treat timber in the 1920s.[7] Wesfarmers accepted responsibility for groundwater and soil contamination with creosote, and the clean-up cost was shared by Wesfarmers and the State government.[7]\r\nState Saw Mills created a township surrounding the Number 1 mill, called Deanmill after a construction engineer named A. Dean.[4] They followed accepted practice at the time of placing a timber mill in a valley with accommodation and other facilities close by.[4] Deanmill Primary School was built in 1914 by the Public Works Department in association with State Saw Mills.[5] The school initially consisted of a single classroom, administration building and shed, all constructed out of timber.[5]\r\nAfter the Government Trading Concerns Act 1912 was passed in December of that year, several State-operated businesses were established.[3] One of these was State Saw Mills, which commenced with purchasing the South-West Timber Hewers\' Co-operative for £80,000.[4] Construction on the State\'s Number 1 sawmill, later called Deanmill, began in 1913, as did construction of the Number 2 and 3 mills at Big Brook, later called Pemberton.[4] The mills cost an estimated £138,000,[4] and were to provide timber railway sleepers for the Trans-Australian Railway.[3] Construction of the mills was delayed by heavy rainfall, and the railway sleepers were delivered late.[4] Other problems included shipping disputes and the Commonwealth government\'s price for sleepers.[4]\r\nDeanmill is a historic timber town located in the South West region of Western Australia, near Manjimup.

The Group Settlement Scheme was largely unsuccessful because the land was difficult to clear and many of the new settlers were not experienced farmers. The settlers who stayed became dairy farmers, which ended during the 1930s Great Depression when the price of butterfat collapsed.[4]\r\nManjimup tourist attractions include the Diamond Tree fire lookout; the Four Aces, which are four 75 metre-tall karri trees over 400 years old; One Tree Bridge, a bridge made of a single karri tree; Fonty\'s Pool; a timber museum called Manjimup Timber Park; and timber sawmills including Deanmill. During wildflower season from October to December, the King Jarrah Heritage Trail is home to various native flowers.[4]\r\nThe railway from Bridgetown was extended to Wilgarup in 1909, and the railway line opened in 1911.[29] As the line\'s terminus was near the Manjimup homestead, the station was named Manjimup.[29] Aside from passengers, trains were used to transport timber to and from the sawmills in the area. The rail yards closed in 1997 and were redeveloped into Manji Park tourism precinct in 2003.[30]\r\nKearnan College was founded by the Sisters of Saint Joseph of the Sacred Heart in 1925 and was originally called St Joseph\'s. The school had 461 students from kindergarten to year 12, as of September 2016.[24][25] Only a primary school in its early years, the high school was added under parish priest Father Stephen Kelly in 1970. With this addition, Kearnan College became the first coeducational catholic school in Western Australia.[26]\r\nManjimup has a mild Mediterranean climate, with cool wet winters and warm dry summers.[37] Manjimup\'s longest consecutive run of cold days was 20 days between 13 July and 1 August 1958, and its longest consecutive wet spell was 44 days between 1 July to 13 August 1946.[38] During this period, 374 mm of rain fell.[38]\r\nManjimup is a town in Western Australia, 307 kilometres (191 mi) south of the state capital, Perth.

Rather than shut down, the mill switched to plantation Tasmanian blue gum and pine in addition to karri.\r\nIn 1913, the new government-owned State Saw Mills began construction of twin sawmills, No 2 and No 3, at the location then known as Big Brook, to supply half a million railway sleepers for the Trans-Australian Railway. The mill site was in a valley to ensure the mills had a regular supply of water and because it was easier to roll logs down hill to the mills. Big Brook became a thriving private mill town, with a hall, store, staff accommodation, mill workers’ cottages, and single men’s huts, and two boarding houses.[3] A more distinctive name was soon sought. The name Walcott was suggested but was rejected by the Post Office due to conflict with Port Walcott, also named after Walcott. William Locke Brockman, local farmer and son of early settler Edward Reveley Brockman, suggested Pemberton. The mill town was well established but by 1921 there was community agitation for a government townsite to be declared. Community pressure resulted in lots being surveyed in 1925 and the Pemberton townsite was gazetted in October 1925.[11]\r\nBeedelup Falls in the Beedelup National Park are 30 km north along The Bibbulmun Track.

The trees have metal rungs that allow visitors to climb them and reach the constructed lookout at the top.\r\nViticulture is now widely established with many investment schemes buying up large areas of pastureland and converting to vineyards.\r\nPemberton is a town in the South West region of Western Australia, named after original settler Pemberton Walcott.\r\nDuring the 1980s, Pemberton began to grow as a tourist town and tourism, particularly domestic, continues to play a key role.\r\nPemberton has a Mediterranean climate, with warm, dry summers and cool, rainy winters.\r\nOther tourist attractions include the Pemberton Tramway Company, Yeagarup Dunes and the Bibbulmun Track. Tours include river cruises, hiking, canoeing and four-wheel drive tours of the national parks.\r\nDuring the 1920s the area was a focus of the Group Settlement Scheme and following the Second World War the War Service Land Settlement Scheme, but with only moderate success.\r\nLake Jasper in the D’Entrecasteaux national park is the largest natural freshwater lake in Western Australia and covers an area of about 450 hectares. It is unique because it has no in or out tributaries and is 10 meters deep and accessible only by 4WD. A little further west is Black Point, in the far northwestern part of the D’Entrecasteaux National Park between Augusta and Windy Harbour. The black Basalt columns were formed about 135 million years ago.

Another company, RGC, operated a mine to the south of the town. In 1998 both companies merged to form Iluka Resources which continues to operate ilmenite mines around the area and produce synthetic rutile at the processing facility to the north of the town along the Bussell Highway.\r\nThe population of the town was 91 (44 males and 47 females) in 1898.[5]\r\nThe town is located on the Capel River and is approximately 19 metres (62 ft) above sea level. Capel has a Mediterranean climate, with hot dry summers and cool wet winters. Daily temperatures range from 13 °C to 40 °C in summer, and from 5 °C to 27 °C in winter. Average annual rainfall is about 830 mm.\r\nHistorically, Capel is a farming area; traditional agricultural pursuits include dairy and beef. In recent times, Capel has become popular for hobby farms, and a number of innovative agricultural pursuits have been introduced, including alpacas, viticulture, aquaculture and growing of blue gums. There is also some mining of mineral sands in the Shire, and tourism is increasingly important to the Shire\'s economy.\r\nThe Capel area was settled very early in the history of colonial Western Australia. The Capel River was discovered by Frederick Ludlow in 1834, but it was not named until the Bussell family settled in the area. The name honours Capel Carter Brockman (1839–1924),[2] daughter of John Bussell (1803–1875),[3] who was named after a Miss Capel Carter, a cousin of the Bussells in England with whom Bussell family members corresponded. In the 1830s a number of settlers followed the Bussells into the area, and both James Stirling and John Hutt, (the first two Governors of Western Australia) took up land in the region. Plans to establish a townsite in the area were first mooted in 1844, but the site was not surveyed until the 1870s and lots were not sold until 1897. Initially the town was named Coolingnup, which is the Noongar Aboriginal name for the place; the name was changed to Capel in 1899.[4]',0,-33.557565,115.558897),(13691,'Capel River','6271','Bunbury','Bunbury','WA','Not yet populated',0,-33.647220,115.669440),(13692,'Forrest Beach','6271','Bunbury','Bunbury','WA','Not yet populated',0,-33.570280,115.471390),(13693,'Peppermint Grove Beach','6271','Bunbury','Bunbury','WA','Not yet populated',0,-33.527945,115.506243),(13694,'Stirling Estate','6271','Bunbury','Bunbury','WA','Not yet populated',0,-33.519440,115.536670),(13695,'Barrabup','6275','Augusta - Margaret River - Busselton','Bunbury','WA','Not yet populated',0,-33.836425,115.661690),(13696,'Carlotta','6275','Augusta - Margaret River - Busselton','Bunbury','WA','Not yet populated',0,-34.096977,115.778516),(13697,'Cundinup','6275','Augusta - Margaret River - Busselton','Bunbury','WA','Not yet populated',0,-33.857630,115.795915),(13698,'Darradup','6275','Augusta - Margaret River - Busselton','Bunbury','WA','Not yet populated',0,-34.098682,115.564009),(13699,'East Nannup','6275','Augusta - Margaret River - Busselton','Bunbury','WA','Not yet populated',0,-34.031110,115.854170),(13700,'Jalbarragup','6275','Augusta - Margaret River - Busselton','Bunbury','WA','Not yet populated',0,-34.044101,115.611612),(13701,'Jarrahwood','6275','Augusta - Margaret River - Busselton','Bunbury','WA','Jarrahwood is a small town located in the South West region of Western Australia, along the Vasse Highway between the towns of Busselton and Nannup.\r\nThe town is named for the Jarrah Wood and Saw Mills Company which operated in the area and operated a private railway from the district to Wonnerup, which was purchased by the Government in 1906.

Baudin named Geographe Bay and Cape Naturaliste after his vessels, and named the river Vasse after a sailor, Thomas Vasse, who was lost as he went overboard and believed to have drowned.\r\nThere are only Christian places of worship in Busselton.

Construction of the jetty began in 1853 and was continually extended until the 1960s when it reached its current length of 1841 metres. It was closed to shipping in 1972, and maintenance was discontinued for a time. Following major damage caused by cyclone Alby in 1978 and a fire in 1999 it was restored and improved. Since 2003 the jetty has offered visitors a tourist train ride, an underwater observatory and an interpretive centre.\r\nHigh schools in the area include Busselton Senior High School (years 8-12), MacKillop Catholic College[14] (years 8-12), Cornerstone Christian College[15] (years K-12), Georgiana Molloy Anglican School (years K-12), Cape Naturaliste College (years 8-12).\r\nWeld Hall located on the corner of Queen and Adelaide St was built in 1881.

The Hall is a single storey brick building with a galvanised roof and is constructed in a simplified Victorian Italianate style, it is one of the oldest remaining structures in the town.[13]\r\nFollowing the closure in the 1950s of the Flinders Bay branch, most of the old line formation was changed in ownership. The railway line also connected onto the Busselton Jetty and was not closed on the jetty until the 1970s.\r\nBusselton is located in the safe Liberal seat of Forrest.

Facilities of the new hospital will include 64 overnight and 20 same-day beds, a new renal unit, two operating and an expansion of the Emergency Department.[17]\r\nThe present name of Busselton derives from the Bussell family. It was first officially used in June 1835.[4] The Bussells, who were not consulted about the name, preferred the name Capel after a relative in England, Capel Carter, but the name Busselton was retained. A town named Capel was later established to the north of Busselton.\r\nFrom about 1927 to 1957, Busselton was also on the WAGR railway line running from Bunbury to Flinders Bay.\r\nBusselton\'s growth over the past decade has been centred along the shores of Geographe Bay; this has created a narrow urban strip 15 km long and around 1 km wide. The heavy coastal development has led to a shortage of beachside blocks.[citation needed]\r\nBusselton is serviced by two local weekly newspapers; the Busselton Dunsborough Mail (Wednesday) and the Busselton Dunsborough times (Friday). The West Australian is available from Monday to Saturday and the Sunday Times is available on Sundays.\r\nEvents are held year round in Busselton. The most notable being:\r\nBusselton was one of the earliest settlements in Western Australia. It was first settled by the Bussell family, who relocated there from their location on the Blackwood River after John Garrett Bussell discovered superior farm land in the area. The Bussells moved to the area in 1834,[3] establishing a cattle station which they named Cattle Chosen. Cattle Chosen quickly became one of the most prosperous stations in the colony, and as a result nearly all of the settlers at Augusta relocated to the area within a few years.

Six of these are open to the public.[9]\r\nMargaret River is the foremost Geographical Indication wine region in the South West Australia Zone, with nearly 55 square kilometres (21 sq mi) under vine and over 138 wineries as at 2008. The region is made up predominantly of boutique-size wine producers, although winery operations range from the smallest, crushing 3.5 tonnes (3.4 long tons; 3.9 short tons) per year, to the largest at around 7,000 tonnes (6,900 long tons; 7,700 short tons).[4][5] The region produces just three percent of total Australian grape production, but commands over 20 percent of the Australian premium wine market.\r\nHumidity levels are ideal during the growing period and the combination of climate, soil and viticulture practices leads to consistently high quality fruit of intense flavour. Consequently, annual vintage results continue to exceed expectations and reinforce Margaret River\'s reputation as one of the premium wine-producing regions of the world.[6][7]\r\nArte-TV produced an episode of Nouveaux paradis about Margaret River. The 2008 documentary shows interviews with (amongst others) tourist officials, surfers, and dolphin watchers. [11] Margaret River was also visited in the 1966 documentary film The Endless Summer. On 25 April 2009, on Sky television\'s Soccer AM, Hugh Jackman called Margaret River the best place he\'s ever been to, citing the surf, the beaches, the food, the wine, the people and the air as his reasons for thinking so. In 2013, many locals featured in the film Drift, starring Sam Worthington, as well as many surfing scenes being shot on location at local surf breaks.[12] Surfing locations included popular breaks such as Grunters and Main Break.[13]\r\nAfter World War I, an attempt by the Government of Western Australia to attract migrants to Western Australia (known as the Group Settlement Scheme) and establish farms in the region attracted new settlers to the town.

The name originates from a cave in the area, Witchcliffe cave, that was recorded by a surveyor in 1900. It is believed the name was given by the Bussell family whose property, Wallcliffe, was established in the area in the 1850s.\r\nThe town was built around the timber industry, with the Witchcliffe sawmill being built in 1922 just east of town for the W.A.

Group 4 were sent to Karridale, and consisted of about 20 families who received a 160-acre (0.65 km2) block and a grant of £10 for the purchase of necessities plus an allowance of 10 shillings per day. Like those in many other areas in which the scheme operated, the participants endured severe hardship and isolation and many walked off the land, particularly after the onset of the 1929 Depression. The scheme was officially abandoned in 1930.\r\nOther timber mills in the area included Kudardup, Boranup and Jarrahdene. Between 1900 and 1914 approximately 17 million railway sleepers were cut from timber milled in the region.[4]\r\nIn 1961, the south west of the state suffered from a series of devastating bushfires that destroyed Dwellingup and totally destroyed the townsite of Karridale and 100,000 acres of farms, forest and bushland south of Margaret River.[5] In Karridale, the historic homestead of M.C. Davies was destroyed also.\r\nKarridale was established as a timber mill in 1884 by M. C. Davies who saw the potential from large virgin forests of Karri trees (Eucalyptus diversicolor) in the area.[2] The Karridale School opened in 1888.[3] At its peak the town was home to 300 men and their families who worked in the forest and at the M.C.Davies Karri and Jarrah Timber Company mill.\r\nTimber from the mill was transported by rail to nearby Hamelin Bay where Davies had built a jetty to support his milling operations. A second jetty at Flinders Bay to the south supported the shipping operations when the weather was unsuited for loading on the west facing coastline. A major storm in 1900 which destroyed the Hamelin Bay jetty as well as a downturn in demand for timber in the early 1900s meant that the industry went into decline and the last mill was closed in 1913.\r\nKarridale was a stopping place on the Busselton to Flinders Bay Branch Railway, which was government run from the 1920s to the 1950s.\r\nKarridale is a small township in the south-west of Western Australia. It is located just north of Augusta and south of Margaret River between Caves Road and Bussell Highway. A newer township was built a short distance north east of the original Old Karridale following fires that destroyed the town in 1961. At the 2006 census, Karridale had a population of 285.[1]\r\nAlthough settled for many years through its milling operations, the townsite was not officially gazetted until 1979.',0,-34.173025,115.097095),(13767,'Nillup','6288','Augusta - Margaret River - Busselton','Bunbury','WA','Not yet populated',0,-34.136630,115.255715),(13768,'Scott River','6288','Augusta - Margaret River - Busselton','Bunbury','WA','Not yet populated',0,-34.259722,115.270520),(13769,'Warner Glen','6288','Augusta - Margaret River - Busselton','Bunbury','WA','Not yet populated',0,-34.126314,115.216190),(13771,'Deepdene','6290','Augusta - Margaret River - Busselton','Bunbury','WA','Not yet populated',0,-34.266983,115.080832),(13772,'East Augusta','6290','Augusta - Margaret River - Busselton','Bunbury','WA','Not yet populated',0,-34.314288,115.172155),(13773,'Kudardup','6290','Augusta - Margaret River - Busselton','Bunbury','WA','Not yet populated',0,-34.262727,115.123987),(13774,'Leeuwin','6290','Augusta - Margaret River - Busselton','Bunbury','WA','Not yet populated',0,-34.313229,115.118909),(13775,'Molloy Island','6290','Augusta - Margaret River - Busselton','Bunbury','WA','Not yet populated',0,-34.268422,115.209679),(13776,'Badgin','6302','Armadale','Perth - South East','WA','Not yet populated',0,-31.846267,117.011892),(13777,'Balladong','6302','Armadale','Perth - South East','WA','Not yet populated',0,-31.908946,116.732848),(13778,'Burges','6302','Armadale','Perth - South East','WA','Not yet populated',0,-31.810516,116.784861),(13779,'Caljie','6302','Armadale','Perth - South East','WA','Not yet populated',0,-31.728493,116.939400),(13780,'Cold Harbour','6302','Armadale','Perth - South East','WA','Not yet populated',0,-31.871390,116.828330),(13781,'Daliak','6302','Armadale','Perth - South East','WA','Not yet populated',0,-31.878610,116.719440),(13782,'Flint','6302','Armadale','Perth - South East','WA','Not yet populated',0,-32.194720,116.461390),(13783,'Flynn','6302','Armadale','Perth - South East','WA','Not yet populated',0,-32.086882,116.319639),(13784,'Gilgering','6302','Armadale','Perth - South East','WA','Not yet populated',0,-32.017500,116.809720),(13785,'Greenhills','6302','Armadale','Perth - South East','WA','Not yet populated',0,-31.929378,116.950094),(13786,'Gwambygine','6302','Armadale','Perth - South East','WA','Not yet populated',0,-31.981236,116.802855),(13787,'Inkpen','6302','Armadale','Perth - South East','WA','Not yet populated',0,-31.844090,116.585052),(13788,'Kauring','6302','Armadale','Perth - South East','WA','Not yet populated',0,-31.931110,117.021940),(13789,'Malebelling','6302','Armadale','Perth - South East','WA','Not yet populated',0,-31.830795,116.915415),(13790,'Mount Hardey','6302','Armadale','Perth - South East','WA','Not yet populated',0,-31.920000,116.852500),(13791,'Mount Observation','6302','Armadale','Perth - South East','WA','Not yet populated',0,-31.901642,116.572256),(13792,'Narraloggan','6302','Armadale','Perth - South East','WA','Not yet populated',0,-31.870830,117.075000),(13793,'Quellington','6302','Armadale','Perth - South East','WA','Not yet populated',0,-31.810430,116.828640),(13794,'St Ronans','6302','Armadale','Perth - South East','WA','Not yet populated',0,-31.895560,116.660280),(13795,'Talbot','6302','Armadale','Perth - South East','WA','Not yet populated',0,-32.025000,116.657780),(13796,'Talbot West','6302','Armadale','Perth - South East','WA','Not yet populated',0,-32.130000,116.699440),(13797,'Wilberforce','6302','Armadale','Perth - South East','WA','Not yet populated',0,-31.791670,116.703060),(13798,'York','6302','Armadale','Perth - South East','WA','\r\nImperial Inn and Town Hall\r\nYork is well serviced with all essential facilities, including York District High School for students from kindergarten to Year 10.

It features music festivals, a motor museum, art galleries, recreational facilities including skydiving and paragliding, many bed and breakfast services and the picturesque Avon River. The town population in 2010 was approximately 3800 and increasing 4% annually.[citation needed]\r\nAnglican Church of the Holy Trinity\r\nThe first decade of settlement in the Avon Valley showed steady progress and a clear indication that the whole district should develop into a rich and prosperous farming area. Following the discovery of gold in the Yilgarn in 1887, the town was teeming with miners, all alighting from the train and preparing to make the long journey across the plains to the goldfields.\r\nMany of York\'s older homes and buildings have now been restored and, while some have retained their original use, some others have been adaptively re-used with success. The Victorian Georgian style Resident Magistrate\'s House, one of the oldest houses in York (dating from the 1840s) now houses the Residency Museum. York churches include the Victorian Romanesque style Holy Trinity Anglican Church (completed in 1854); St Patrick\'s Roman Catholic Church (designed in the Gothic Revival style by the convict architect Joseph Nunan and completed in 1886); and the York Uniting Church constructed of local granite in the Gothic style (1888). The 19th century Western Australia Government Architect, George Temple Poole, designed a number of York\'s heritage buildings, namely the Federation Arts and Crafts style Post and Telegraph Office (1893); the Courthouse (c. 1896);[12] the Federation Arts and Crafts style York Hospital (opened in 1896); and the 19th century portion of York Primary School: all are on the State Heritage Register. Other Gold Rush buildings include: the railway station buildings, now a museum (built in 1885); the York Roller Flour Mill, a major source of employment, at the entrance to York (1892); and the Victorian Filigree style Imperial Hotel (built in 1886 to accommodate the gold miners). Among early 20th century buildings are the Federation Free Classical style Town Hall (designed by Wright, Powell and Cameron and built in 1911), and the Federation Filigree style Castle Hotel (c.1905).\r\nIn September 1831 Dale escorted the first party of settlers to the district, reaching the Avon valley on 16 September. They immediately set about the construction of huts, the preparation required for their stock and the cultivation of new land. Dale proposed an area two miles south of the summit of Mt Bakewell as the site for a future town to serve the district.[8]\r\nYork is the oldest inland town in Western Australia, situated 97 kilometres (60 mi) east of Perth, and is the seat of the Shire of York. The York district and town took its name from York County, Western Australia (in turn named after Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany). The area was first settled in 1831, two years after Perth was settled in 1829. A town was established in 1835 with the release of town allotments and the first buildings were erected in 1836.\r\nYork Flour Mill\r\nIn September 1833 a garrison of eight troops of the 21st North British Fusiliers was stationed at York.[9][10] Rules and regulations for the assignment of town allotments at York were gazetted in September 1834 and allotments were advertised for sale from July 1835.[2][11]\r\nMedia related to York, Western Australia at Wikimedia Commons\r\nA township did not begin to appear until 1836. In July 1836 York comprised two houses, a barn, an army barracks and some out-houses, with about 50 acres of cleared land.[7]\r\nYork Railway Station\r\nAs a result, Lieutenant-Governor Stirling decided that the new district should be thrown open for selection and this was done by Government Notice on 11 November 1830. By December 1830, 250,000 acres had been allotted, and in January 1831, 80,000 acres. Before the end of 1831 a further 6,030 acres in small lots had been taken up.[7]\r\nYork is in a temperate climate zone and experiences distinctly dry (and hot) summers[13] and cool, wet winters.[14] Under the Köppen climate classification, York has a Mediterranean climate.\r\nCo-op, Post Office, Courthouse\r\nEnsign Robert Dale, a 20-year-old officer of the 63rd Regiment, led a small party in the first exploratory journey over the Darling Range, during the winter months of 1830 into what was later to be kno',0,-31.887940,116.768389),(13799,'Bally Bally','6304','Wheat Belt - North','Western Australia - Wheat Belt','WA','Not yet populated',0,-32.183978,117.116351),(13800,'Beverley','6304','Wheat Belt - North','Western Australia - Wheat Belt','WA','In 1908, the Goldfields Water Supply Scheme was extended to supply the town with water, and by World War I, the town had four hotels, four banks, two bakeries, two tailors, three tearooms, a jeweller and two hairdressers, amongst other businesses, and in 1938, a new town hall opened.\r\nBeverley Long-term Averages\r\nBeverley has a strong history of aviation. The Silver Centenary, Western Australia\'s oldest existing aircraft was built to commemorate the State\'s centenary in 1929, and was constructed from chalk drawings sketched on the floor of the town powerhouse.[7] The town airfield has been home for the last forty years to the Beverley Soaring Society, one of the biggest gliding clubs in Australia (120 members). The club was founded in 1973. As at December 2013, the club has three 2-seat training aircraft, two single seat sailplanes and two Piper Pawnee Tugs. Additionally members own a further thirty five private gliders hangared at the airfield. Club members regularly compete at club, state and national levels and hold several State and National gliding distance, height and speed records.\r\n10 kilometres (6 mi) to the northwest of the town is the Avondale Agricultural Research Station. Avondale gets its name from the Avon and Dale rivers which join near the farm. For over 80 years, Avondale has been a major centre for agricultural research, and since 1979 has been home to an extensive collection of historical farm machinery. The station hosts a number of events during the year, including the Ploughing Days in June.\r\nWhile settlers arrived from the 1860s onwards, and a town was established in 1868, it wasn\'t until the arrival of the Great Southern Railway in 1886 that the town started to grow, and with the completion of the railway in 1889 to Albany, Beverley became an important centre. By early 1898 the population of the town was 190, 93 males and 97 females.[3]\r\nBeverley is on Great Southern Highway, 133 kilometres (83 mi) southeast of Perth, and provides commercial and industrial support to the surrounding agricultural area. Each year in August the town hosts an agricultural show. A museum, formerly the Settlers Arms Hotel, offers local history exhibits. In addition, a town hall, district high school, bank, shopping facilities, accommodation (hotel, Beverley B&B, caravan park), council offices, district hospital and medical centre, a telecentre (with TAFE affiliation) and various sporting facilities are located within the town. A wide range of building styles exist.\r\nAccess to tournament information here.\r\nBeverley is a town in the Wheatbelt region of Western Australia, 133 kilometres (83 mi) south-east of the state capital, Perth, between York and Brookton on the Great Southern Highway.

See statistic here.\r\nBeverley hosts an annual Easter tennis tournament from the 25–28 March.\r\nBeverley Daily Records\r\nHowever, since the 1950s, with improved transport, communications and farming methods, the population of the Shire of Beverley fell from 1,968 in 1954 to 1,433 in 1991,[4] and several banks and other town services closed. The population has started to grow again due to the popularity of rural residential estates and the town\'s proximity to Perth.[5]\r\nThe town is believed to be named after Beverley in Yorkshire, from where some of the earliest explorers of the Avon valley originated, including Colonial Surgeon Charles Simmons, an early landowner in the district. Land at Beverley was set aside for a townsite in 1831, just two years after the Swan River Colony\'s foundation,[2] after a glowing report to Governor James Stirling by Ensign (later Lieutenant) Robert Dale, who made three trips to the York-Beverley area. The district was surveyed in 1843.\r\nFor more information regarding the team click here.\r\nBeverley is also home to the football team the Beverley Redbacks Football Club (BRFC).

In 1897, the Government set aside land for subdivision here, and in 1903 lots were surveyed and the town of Buchanan gazetted.

However, after the construction of the Trans-Australian Railway in 1917, another railway station named after Barton in the South Australian stretch of the Nullarbor Plain led to another name change - this time to Piesse, after two prominent residents Frederick Henry Piesse and Charles Austin Piesse, in December 1918.

The Aboriginal name is Waitjen, having been first recorded for the lake by a surveyor in 1869-72. There is uncertainty about the actual meaning of \'Wagin\' but it is likely that it either means \'the place where emus watered\' or \'Emu\'s watering hole\'.\r\nThe first European explorer through the area was John Septimus Roe, the Surveyor General of Western Australia in 1835 en route to Albany from Perth. Between 1835 and 1889 a few settlers eked a simple living by cutting sandalwood and shepherding small flocks of sheep. Land was granted to pastoralists in the Wagin area from the late 1870s onwards.\r\nIn 1934 the town was extensively flooded after the area experienced 5.4 inches (137 mm) of rainfall in a short period of time, the heaviest for 20 years. Water over a foot deep flowed through the Town Hall and along business premises and dwellings along Tudor Street.

It was named after the Dutch East Indiaman Leeuwin, which sighted the coast from Hamelin Bay to Point D\'Entrecasteaux in 1622. The coastline of the Denmark area was observed for the first time in 1627 by the Dutchman François Thijssen, captain of the ship \'t Gulden Zeepaert (The Golden Seahorse), who sailed to the east as far as Ceduna in South Australia and back. Captain Thijssen had discovered the south coast of Australia and charted about 1,800 kilometres (1,100 mi) of it between Cape Leeuwin and the Nuyts Archipelago.[3]\r\nDenmark is surrounded by native woodland with a large variety of trees, including the eucalypts marri, karri, jarrah and red tingle. The latter can reach a height of 60 metres (200 ft). A distinctive local tree is the red-flowering gum.\r\nBy the 1960s the population had increased to 1,500 and Denmark was becoming attractive to alternative life-stylers and early retirees. Intensive agriculturists such as wine growers had discovered the value of the rich karri loam for their vineyards. Riesling and Chardonnay were the first grapes grown on Denmark soil, soon followed by other varieties. Within 50 years the area became a wine subregion of critical acclaim, as part of the Great Southern Wine Region.[10][11] The first winery, Tinglewood, opened in 1976,[12] and by 2008, over twenty vineyards had been established around Denmark.[13]\r\nDenmark is a rural town with timber milling, orcharding, beef cattle and dairy farming as its primary industries. Soil and climate attract wine growers, with tourism being the fastest growing business in Denmark.[citation needed] There is limited commercial fishing in Wilson Inlet. Denmark has no harbour.\r\nDenmark was awarded the title of Australia\'s Tidiest Town in 1998.[18]\r\nThe demography fluctuates depending on tourism; with the town at full capacity during school holidays and throughout the summer. The many holiday houses kept in Denmark usually belong to wealthy Perth-based families. During the census (Tuesday 9 August) 23% of dwellings were unoccupied (national average 11%).[1]\r\nDenmark is on the South Coast Highway, and is serviced by the TransWA public transport system. The town has an airstrip for small planes.\r\nThe town is home to the Western Australian College of Agriculture - Denmark, a 560 hectare working farm and educational facility for Year 10, 11 and 12 students providing specialist education in farming and farm-related studies.[17]\r\nThere are many indigenous bird species, including splendid fairy-wrens, emus, Australian white ibis, Australian magpies and Australian ringnecks. Many species of reptiles including snakes and skinks can be found. Marsupials such as the western grey kangaroo, the southern brown bandicoot and the common brushtail possum also live in the area.\r\nDenmark is a coastal town located on Wilson Inlet in the Great Southern region of Western Australia, 423 kilometres (263 mi) south-south-east of the state capital of Perth. At the 2011 census, Denmark had a population of 2,280,[1] however the population can be several times the base population during tourist seasons.\r\nThe Denmark River was named in December 1829 by naval ship\'s surgeon Thomas Braidwood Wilson after his mentor, naval surgeon Alexander Denmark, Physician of the Fleet, Resident Physician at the Royal Hospital Haslar, and past-Physician to the Mediterranean Fleet. Wilson discovered the river while exploring the area in company with the Noongar Mokare from King George Sound, John Kent (officer in charge of the Commissariat at Frederick Town, King George Sound), two convicts and Private William Gough of the 39th Regiment, while his ship the Governor Phillip was being repaired at King George Sound.[4][5][6]\r\nThe population declined dramatically, and revived only with the introduction of the Group Settlement Scheme in the 1920s. Small farms of 40 ha (100 acres) were cleared from woodland to create pasture for cattle, dairying and orcharding, mainly apples. Conditions were often poor and some of the small farmers could hardly survive. They worked in one of the timber mills operating around the middle of the 20th century.\r\nIn August 1895 C & E Millar completed the purchase of 20,000 acres of freehold timber country at Denmark River, known as the Denmark Estate, and in October 1895, after a stock exchange listing in London to raise the capital, Millars Karri and Jarrah Forests Limited commenced a railway extension from Torbay to Denmark River.

These grantees became known as soldier settlers. At the time Salmon Gums was regarded as being on the fringe of arable land. The low soil fertility and marginal average rainfall of 341mm meant that yields were poor prior to the 1950s. As a result, the land was not in high demand, so the opportunity cost to the government was quite small.\r\nIn 2001 a Perth-based iron ore company announced an investigation into a large lignite deposit at Salmon Gums for use reducing its phosphorus-rich iron ore currently being mined at Koolyanobbing. As of 2009 all plans for the mining of the lignite has been suspended indefinitely due to the stock market collapse in early 2009. The sudden drop in oil prices would make the refinement of the oil suspended in the lignite financially unviable.\r\nAgricultural research was boosted prior to the Second World War by the establishment of the Salmon Gums Research Station.[6] In 1949 a similar station, the Esperance Downs Research Station was established near Esperance. Research at the latter quickly led to the discovery that soil in the Esperance region was deficient in trace elements, reportedly phosphorus, copper and zinc, and the addition of these greatly improved fertility and crop yields.[7] Since then the region, including Salmon Gums, has become a successful producer of wheat, sheep and cattle.\r\nSalmon Gums is a small town in Western Australia located 106 km north of Esperance on the Coolgardie-Esperance Highway. The name is derived from a prominent stretch of Eucalyptus salmonophloia (Salmon Gum) trees which formed a landmark in the town\'s early days.[2] The town is part of the Shire of Esperance.[3] At the 2006 census, Salmon Gums had a population of 789.[1]\r\nThe first potential use of a townsite was as a watering spot for the proposed Esperance to Norseman Railway,[2] since Salmon Gums is roughly halfway between these two towns. Land for a town-site was set aside in 1912 and the name was recommended in 1916. The town was gazetted in 1925, when the Esperance to Salmon Gums section of the railway was completed.[5]\r\nThe surrounding areas produce wheat and other cereal crops.

A major nearby tourist attraction, 20 minutes away from the town centre, is the Cape Le Grand National Park, which offers a picturesque coast of largely granite terrain and sheltered white sand beaches. The park is a popular spot for recreational fishing, as well as four wheel drive enthusiasts and hikers.\r\nExports for the year ending June 2005 were 7,694,155 tonnes, including 1.8 million tonnes of grain, and 5.5 million tonnes of iron ore which is railed from Koolyanobbing.\r\nEsperance also has a number of wind turbines supplying electricity to the town.[20] Esperance had the first electrical wind farm in Australia, built at Salmon Beach as a research facility in 1987.\r\nA railway line between Coolgardie and Esperance was completed in 1927.[9]\r\nA parliamentary inquiry presented its report in November 2007.[23] Before long, additional concerns were raised about pollution caused by nickel dust escaping from exported ore.[24] In October 2008, the Esperance Port Authority banned the export of nickel after emission targets were exceeded twice, but the ban, which threatened Western Australia\'s $8 billion nickel industry, was overturned by the newly elected Premier of Western Australia, Colin Barnett.[25]\r\nIn 2007, the deaths of thousands of wild birds alerted residents to a toxic hazard which was found to be the unsafe transport by truck and rail of lead ore from Wiluna for export by ship. When elevated levels of lead were measured in a number of adults and children, as well as in water tanks, a multimillion-dollar cleanup was paid for by the state government. The miner, Magellan Metals, was banned from exporting lead through the port.[22]\r\nEsperance has the only port in the south-east of Western Australia – the Esperance Port Authority completed a A$54 million upgrade in 2002.

The Walkatching spelling is probably the most accurate, as Aboriginal names in this region rarely end in em. The change of spelling from Wyalcatchem to Wyalkatchem in 1911 was done by the Department of Lands & Surveys according to rules the Department had adopted for spelling Aboriginal names.

Following the survey of the lots the townsite was gazetted spelt Wyalkatchem in 1911.\r\nThe extensive railway barracks in town are leased by the shire council from the Western Australian Governments Railway Commission.

At the 2006 census, Moora had a population of 1,822.[1]\r\nThe Moora Agricultural Show is held every year in September and includes a full Equestrian Program, Fire Works, Fashion Parade, entertainment and some exciting exhibits. The Moora Cup Race Day is one of the biggest events on Moora\'s social calendar and is held every year in October.\r\nMoora lies within the Moora Important Bird Area, so identified by BirdLife International because it supports up to 60 breeding pairs of the endangered Short-billed Black Cockatoo.[5] Surrounding the town are several rural activities (such as the growing of wheat, barley, canola, oaten hay and lupins, as well as the raising of sheep, cattle and pigs) and a silica mine located 15 km north of the townsite.\r\nMusician Paul Harding from electronic music group Pendulum attended Moora Primary School.\r\nIn March 1999, the town suffered a major flood when ex-Tropical Cyclone Elaine caused the Moore River to break its banks with the evacuation of 1000 people.[4] Just as the community was recovering, another major rainfall event on the already saturated land in May the same year caused yet another flood in the town.\r\nThe surrounding areas produce wheat and other cereal crops.

The townsite was gazetted in 1907.[2]\r\nThe name is Indigenous Australian in origin and was the name of a nearby spring. The word Watheroo is derived from the word wardo which means little bird or more specifically the willy wagtail or from the word wardoro which means water.[5]\r\nFollowing flooding along the Moore River in 1907, the railway lines between Watheroo and Moora were closed for some time when parts of the track were washed away.[3] Rail services were again affected in 1917 when 1.7 inches (43 mm) of rain fell in three hours causing more flooding, washways and the railyard in town to be submerged.[4]\r\nWatheroo is a small town in the Wheatbelt region of Western Australia.',0,-30.298755,116.058433),(14423,'Green Head','6514','Mid West','Western Australia - Outback (South)','WA','The town was named after the nearby headland, which was originally named in 1875 by Staff-Commander William Edwin Archdeacon R.N., who was in charge of the Admiralty survey of the coast of Western Australia.[4] The name is descriptive.[5] Land was set aside for a camping reserve in 1946 and the popularity of the area led to a demand for building blocks in the 1950s. Lots were surveyed in 1959 and the townsite was gazetted on 7 January 1966.\r\nGreen Head has numerous vantage points for beach fishing, where catches include whiting, herring, tailor, skippy, and cobbler. Two recreational boat ramps service the town, one near the jetty and the other at South Bay for smaller boats. A boat provides access to a variety of fish as well as the local crayfish (rock-lobster).\r\nSouth Bay is a long white sand beach with clear turquoise water.\r\nThe warm Leeuwin Current from the north brings tropical sea life that swims with temperate species, creating a diverse diving environment offshore. Hard and soft corals, along with sponges, cover the numerous limestone reefs. Seagrass meadows and the absence of rivers flowing into the sea allows for very healthy conditions for marine life.\r\nGreen Head is a well known sailboarding destination thanks to the strong sea breeze that blows from December until February. Although popular amongst the windsurfing community it still remains relatively uncrowded. Sandboarding is another activity available with specific beaches to sandboard where sand erosion is not a problem.\r\nDynamite Bay is an almost circular bay in Green Head that is sheltered from the strong winds off the coast by a low lying rocky cliff that circles the beach. Snorkelling, swimming and wind-surfing are popular activities in the area.[7]\r\nLocal attractions include sea lions a short boat ride off the Green Head coastline at North Fishermans Island, which hosts the second largest population of sea lions on the Mid West coast. Numbers fluctuate between 40 and 80,depending on the breeding cycle. Interaction can be experienced with these inquisitive mammals by a government licensed charter.[6]\r\nThe Green Head town site is surrounded by nature reserves and a national park. Lesueur National Park covers 2,700 hectares and is renowned for its diversity of wild flowers. 1200 species have been identified but not surprisingly there are still over 300 species to be identified. The Department of Environment and Conservation improved infrastructure by installing a bitumen loop road for access to the unique flora and fauna. The best period to see the wildflowers in bloom is from August through until October.\r\nGreen Head is a popular tourist destination and has a number of accommodation choices.\r\nPoint Louise, Green Head\'s main surf break, is also a good location for snorkeling with clear water is very clear and there is more than enough reef to explore it all. Further north are numerous bays ideal for snorkelling, kayaking, swimming and picnic areas with picnic tables.\r\nA well maintained gravel road accesses the bays, which were once dominated by squatters\' shacks, built since the 1950s. Shack removal in the Shire of Coorow in 1994 enabled development of the coastal drive and a series of recreational sites adjacent to Green Head.\r\nThe first Europeans known to visit the Green Head coast were Dutch sailors in the 1600s, sailing to Indonesia for trade. Several Dutch ships were wrecked on the Western Australian reefs, among them the Vergulde Draeck (Gilt Dragon). Abraham Leeman and crew from the Waeckende Boey, while searching in the ship\'s small boat for survivors of the Vergulde Draeck, were marooned on Fishermans Island just south of Green Head in 1658.[3]\r\nThere is one main paddle-out surf break at Point Louise, best suited for beginners or malibu riders when the swell is under two metres. Swells bigger than 2 metres create a more powerful wave that suits intermediate to advanced surfers. Green Head has many options to explore off-shore reefs for waves but require use of a boat.\r\nGreen Head is a small Australian coastal town in the Shire of Coorow. The town is situated between Geraldton and Perth in the Mid West region of Western Australia along Indian Ocean Drive. Its beaches and lifestyle provide a relaxed holiday atmosphere.

Stromatolites are an example of the earliest record of life on earth.

At the northern edge of the Hamelin Pool area is the Wooramel Seagrass Bank.[3] The marine reserve is situated adjacent to the Hamelin Station reserve and the historic Hamelin Pool Telegraph Station about 30 kilometres (19 mi) west of the Overlander Roadhouse on the North West Coastal Highway. Access is via Hamelin Pool Road and then through the Hamelin Pool Telegraph Station grounds. Access is free.\r\nHamelin Pool is hypersaline (it has approximately double the salinity of normal seawater), providing an ideal environment for the Stromatolites to grow, and inhibiting other marine life which would normally feed on the bacteria. The cyanobacteria live in communities on the sea bed at densities of 3 billion individuals per square metre. They are the simplest life forms to use photosynthesis to provide food and oxygen. They provided the early Earth with most of its oxygen atmosphere billions of years before plants appeared. Very fine particles of solids i.e. sand, crushed shell etc. are trapped by the sticky bacteria, to become cemented with calcium carbonate produced by the bacteria, thereby building up the stromatolite structures. Some structures are pillars up to 1.5 metres (5 ft) high and have taken thousands of years to grow. In the Marble Bar area of Western Australia there are fossil stromatolites approximately 50 metres (160 ft) high and 30 metres (98 ft) diameter. These are estimated to be over three billion years old. Typical growth is about 0.5 millimetres (0.020 in) per year.\r\nThe Marine Reserve covers 1,270 square kilometres (490 sq mi). It is one of only a few places in the world where living marine stromatolites can be found.[4] Other locations for stromatolites include an underwater site (6 metres (20 ft)deep) in the Caribbean, Persian Gulf, and in the Great Salt Lake of Utah. Hamelin Pool contains the most diverse range of stromatolites in the world.[5][6]\r\nAt Hamelin Pool there is an interpretive boardwalk for tourists to venture out and examine the stromatolite structures. This is the only access area for the general public because of the fragile nature of the environment in the Hamelin Pool.[9]\r\nThe Hamelin Pool Marine Nature Reserve is a protected marine nature reserve located in the UNESCO World Heritage–listed Shark Bay in the Gascoyne region of Western Australia.

The bridge was designed in 1934 to replace two dangerous rail crossings and a rudimentary water crossing. Construction began in January 1935, and was completed relatively quickly, with the opening ceremony held in August 1935. The bridge has undergone various improvement and maintenance works since then, including widening by three metres (10 ft) in 1959–60, but remained a safety hazard, with increasing severity and numbers of accidents through the 1970s and 1980s.[13] Planning for a highway bypass of Clackline and the Clackline Bridge began in the 1990s,[13] and it was constructed between January 2007 and February 2008.[14] The local community had been concerned that the historic b',0,-31.719218,116.506842),(14581,'Bejoording','6566','Wheat Belt - North','Western Australia - Wheat Belt','WA','Bejoording is a small town in the Wheatbelt region of Western Australia.\r\nThe land was earmarked to be developed as a townsite in 1839 and left vacant for that purpose.

The area supports a range of farming activities including wheat, sheep, cattle and sandalwood. The town is a receival site for Cooperative Bulk Handling.[3]\r\nIn 1932 the Wheat Pool of Western Australia announced that the town would have two grain elevators, each fitted with an engine, installed at the railway siding.[2]\r\nPopulation growth in Morawa has been fairly stable since the 1990s, without much increase, possibly due to people moving out to the Perth metropolitan area. Farms had been amalgamating for a number of years for economic reasons and the larger farms required fewer staff.\r\nThe name Morawa is an Indigenous Australian name; it probably derives from the Morowar, the local dialect\'s word for the dalgite. The name was first used on maps of the area in 1910, in reference to a rock hole. When the railway was being planned in 1913, it was decided to locate a siding at the location, and the name Morawa was chosen for it. The Lands Department then decided to establish a townsite there, and Morawa was gazetted in September 1913. In 1921 the Railways Department decided that Morawa was too similar to Mullewa and requested a name change. In response, the town\'s name was changed to Merkanooka in January 1922. However the Railway Department, which had pressed for the name change in the first place, did not rename the siding, and in June the town\'s name reverted to Morawa at the request of the townspeople.\r\nThe biodiversity of rangeland around Morawa has been reduced by land clearing, changed fire regimes, feral pests and weeds, and pastoralism but still remains an important characteristic of the region. The Department of Environment and Conservation (formerly CALM) has undertaken a biodiversity survey of the area encompassing Morawa. Sporadic ranges of hills are separated by large areas of land and many have evolved their own unique endemic species and biological communities. Some of these are associated only with the Banded Ironstone Formation rocks that are targeted for iron ore mining.\r\nMorawa features a semi-arid climate with hot dry summers and mild to cool, slightly wetter winters.\r\nAccommodation in Morawa includes the Shire-owned Caravan Park in White Street, the Morawa Motor Hotel on Manning Road, Everlastings guest homes on Evans Street and the Morawa Marian Convent Bed and Breakfast in Davis Street. The famous miniature John Hawes Presbytery is located opposite the Bed and Breakfast. A former Western Australian Premier, Carmen Lawrence, attended the Morawa Convent School. One of her classrooms is now a B&B en-suite unit.\r\n5.1 million tonnes of haematite iron ore was taken from the Koolanooka Hills mine between 1966 and 1974.\r\nDue to renewed international demand for iron ore, and dramatic increases in prices being paid, the iron ore deposits around Morawa have attracted interest from junior mining companies such as Midwest Corp., Mount Gibson Mining, Gindalbie Metals and Red River Resources. Midwest Corp has spent several million dollars on infrastructure including roadworks to, and weighbridge facilities at, Koolanooka Mine. It is currently (May 2006) trucking haematite fines (<6 millimetres particle size) left over as waste from the 1966–74 Western Mining iron ore operation. When the export to China of these several million tonnes is complete, Midwest Corp plans to exploit further haematite discoveries on their leases (pending environmental assessment and approval). Substantial quantities of magnetite ore are also understood to exist on their holdings. Mount Gibson Mining also holds mining tenements at Koolanooka South, with reserves of magnetite ore. Magnetite mining operations would require the construction of a concentrator plant and either a rail link or magnetite slurry pipeline from Morawa to the port of Geraldton or to a new port to be built at Oakajee (north of Geraldton). Red River Resources hold tenements just 20 km south of Koolanooka at its Feral Prospect. They have currently identified 5 zones of iron enrichment in BIF ranging in strike length from 100m-500m.\r\nThe Karara Mining joint venture between Gindalbie Metals and Chinese steel producer, Ansteel, has substantial holdings 85 kilometres (53 mi) east of Morawa. Current 2015 reserves are 1,735 million tonnes of 36% iron. The low-grade magnetite iron ore is processed on site to produce a high-grade concentrate for use in steel making.[4]\r\nMorawa is a town in the Mid West region of Western Australia. It is located within the Shire of Morawa, approximately 370 kilometres (230 mi) north of the state capital Perth, on the railway line between Wongan Hills and Mullewa.\r\nMost of the farmland around Morawa was given to returned servicemen after the First World War und',0,-29.210541,116.009247),(14632,'Pintharuka','6623','Mid West','Western Australia - Outback (South)','WA','During the planning of the railway to be constructed between Mullewa and Wongan Hills in 1912 the local progress association requested that a townsite be surveyed at the siding that was to be built in the present townsite.

The first pastoral leases including Youanmi Station, Yuinmery and Lake Barlee Stations were being established at this time.[6]\r\nThe town was first settled in 1894 as part of a gold rush after a team of prospectors including Ernest Shillington first discovered gold about 20 km south of the present townsite. Following the influx of miners the local progress association requested that a townsite be declared in 1905. Correspondence of the time shows that the area was locally known as Hans Irvine\'s Find and that a large amount of money had been spent on building hotels, banks and other services required by the residents. The townsite was gazetted as Sandstone in 1906.[2]\r\nIn 1910 the railway was completed between Mount Magnet and Sandstone.[4] The Jundoo Dam was completed in 1910 to provide water for the steam trains; the dam could hold 16 megalitres (3.5 million imperial gallons) of water and cost £5,000 to build. Most of the original dam works still exist today. The population of the town was approximately 2,000 adults at this time, and boasted two schools.[5]\r\nBy 1907 the population of the town had swelled to 6,000–8,000 and it boasted four hotels, four butchers, two banks, a staffed police station and many other stores. A brewery was also constructed in 1907 by an Irishman, I.V. Kearney, to satisfy the local demand. He built the brewery on a breakaway on top of a cliff about 35 feet high. Water was pumped to the top level for brewing and the beer was stored in the cellars below to keep it cool even in the hotter weather.[3]\r\nToday, Sandstone is the administrative centre of the Shire of Sandstone local government area. A local sight to see is London Bridge, a natural bridge that is part of the Sandstone Heritage Trail. Sandstone was the inspiration for the mining town in Randolph Stow\'s 1963 novel Tourmaline.[8] The smallest of the hotels built in town, the National, constructed in 1909 from locally made bricks, is the only one left remaining.\r\nA state-run battery operated in the town from 1904 to 1982.

As World War I drew men from the goldfields into the Australian Army the townsite of Day Dawn was abandoned. After the war many of the mines did not reopen and this started the decline of Cue as a major population centre. After the Great Depression and the fall in the price of gold, by 1933 the population of Cue had dropped to fewer than 500. The current population is around 300; the major employer is the Crosslands iron ore mine west of Cue. The Shire of Cue has ten employees and most other residents are self-employed as prospectors or in supplying the tourist and sheep-grazing industries.\r\nCue is a small town in the Mid West region of Western Australia, located 620 km north-east of Perth. At the 2006 census, Cue had a population of 328.[1] It is also known as the Queen of the Murchison.

Michael Fitzgerald and Edward Heffernan collected 260 ounces after being given a nugget by an Aboriginal known as \'Governor\'. Tom Cue travelled to Nannine to register their claim. The townsite was gazetted in 1893 and named after Tom Cue.\r\nThe area is prone to the occasional inundation, in 1912 the area was struck by drought, followed by flooding in 1913 when the town received 2.19 inches (56 mm) of rain over the course of a day resulting in washaways and other storm damage.[4] In 1925 several buildings in the town collapsed following heavy rain and flood waters. The town received 259 points 2.59 inches (66 mm) of rain over the course of two days.[5]\r\nThe town\'s first water supply was a well in the centre of the main street; after an outbreak of typhoid fever, the well was capped with a rotunda built over the top.

It is located 764 km north-east of Perth and may be reached by the Great Northern Highway. It is a centre for sheep and cattle transshipment, initially by rail but now by road trains. It is also a regional home to the Royal Flying Doctor Service and the School of the Air. It is connected by public transport to Geraldton with connections to Perth via Transwa coach service N4. No viable horticultural industry exists in the area, although extensive but poor cattle stations in the Murchison and Gascoyne exist.\r\nSuccess on the Meekatharra field was short-lived. It was only because a second gold discovery occurred in 1899 that the town survived. In 1901 the Meekatharra State Battery began operation and by Christmas Day 1903 the township had been officially gazetted.\r\nMeekatharra is a former gold rush town. It seems the first settlement at Meekatharra occurred in 1894 and that, in May 1896, after the prospectors Meehan, Porter and Soich discovered gold, miners moved to the new settlement from the other East Murchison fields and mining grew rapidly in scale and sophistication. The Peak Hill mining town was founded in 1892 approximately 100 km up the road during this initial gold rush.\r\nA 2,181-metre (7,156-foot) runway, now known as Meekatharra Airport, was built by the Americans during World War II. It serves as an important ETOPS diversion airport for inbound transcontinental flights to Australia. Skippers Aviation provide services to Perth on Monday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.[11]\r\nFrom 1927 until 1931, a railway line operated from Meekatharra to the manganese mine at Horseshoe, some 80 miles (128 km) distant.[7]\r\nThe climate is hot and dry. The annual rainfall is between 200 and 500 millimetres (7.9 and 19.7 in). The driest months of the year is August through to November.\r\nMeekatharra was an important location in the Western Australian Government Railways system - being the northernmost location in the Northern Railway railway network, apart from the isolated Marble Bar Railway branch out of Port Hedland. For a while a further branch line continued eastwards to Wiluna. The line was closed from Mullewa and pulled up in the 1970s. In the 2000s, new iron ore prospects may see the railway return.[10]\r\nIn 1906 Alfred Wernam Canning was appointed to develop a stock route from the East Kimberley to the Murchison. The stock route, comprising 54 wells, was completed in 1908 and, when the railway arrived in Meekatharra in 1910, the town became the railhead at the end of the route. In many ways the railway ensured the town\'s survival. In 1910 it took the first shipment of wool out of the area and it continued to serve the local pastoral interests until it was closed down in 1978.\r\nMeekatharra is a town in the Mid West region of Western Australia. Meekatharra is a Yamatji word meaning \'place of little water\'. At the 2011 census, Meekatharra had a population of 812, with 47.0% being of Aboriginal descent.[1]\r\nMeekatharra is mentioned in Kevin Bloody Wilson\'s 1985 song Living Next Door To Alan.[13]\r\nThe town and surrounding stations were isolated by flood waters in 1926 resulting in provisions in the town running low after supplies were unable to get through after a week.[6]',0,-26.591164,118.496352),(14661,'Peak Hill','6642','Mid West','Western Australia - Outback (South)','WA','Early exploration at the site occurred in the 1890s,[7][8] when gold was discovered by William John Wilson in 1892.[9] The townsite was gazetted in 1897,[9] and the field has had varied fortunes even in early years.[10][11] Before 1913, the mine produced some 270,000 ounces of gold.[4] Peak Hill was also included as a location in a regional newspaper network of more outlying mining communities in the 1920s and 1930s.[12]\r\nPeak Hill is the name of a goldfield,[2] locality and the site of a gold mining[3] ghost town in the Murchison Region of Western Australia.

He and his exploration party arrived at the head of Nickol Bay, landing near what was to become Roebourne, and travelling about 60 km inland to present day Millstream Station. Gregory regarded the area as highly suitable for pastoral settlement. The first settlers, including Gregory\'s cousin Emma Withnell and her young family, arrived in the Roebourne area in 1863. The Withnells established themselves on the banks of the Harding River 13 km from the coast, where they had access to a reasonable fresh water supply, and took up 30,000 acres (120 km²) at the foot of Mount Welcome. In common with many settlers at the time, they hired local Aboriginal people to work on their properties as shepherds, labourers and shearers.\r\nMedia related to Roebourne, Western Australia at Wikimedia Commons\r\nRoebourne, Holy Trinity Church\r\nRoebourne /ˈroʊbərn/ is a former gold rush town in Western Australia\'s Pilbara region. It is 202 km from Port Hedland and 1,563 km from Perth, the state\'s capital. It prospered during its gold boom of the late 19th century and was once the largest settlement between Darwin and Perth. At the 2006 census, Roebourne had a population of 857.[1]\r\nThe hottest temperature ever measured in the town was 49.4 °C (120.9 °F) on 21 December 2011.[10]\r\nGold from Nullagine, discovered in 1878, and surrounding copper and tin mines contributed to Roebourne\'s prosperity in the 1880s and 1890s. With the decline of both, Roebourne lost the majority of its European population and became a shadow of its former self. Remnants from that era of prosperity are various National Trust buildings around the town.\r\nRoebourne\'s name honours John Septimus Roe, the first Surveyor General of Western Australia.[2]\r\nCurrently Roebourne serves the passing highway traffic and tourism, especially as the gateway to many national parks in the interior. The town\'s education needs are met by the Roebourne School (1905), a K-12 school serving about 250 Aboriginal students. Roebourne also contains a TAFE campus, library and telecentre, as well as a small hospital. Many other services are provided from Karratha, 40 km away.\r\nFormer Roebourne Shire Offices (1888)\r\nIn later years, Roebourne became notorious for the struggles between Aboriginals and police that were documented in a federal report dealing with Aboriginal deaths in custody,[9] which were documented as a major issue in Aboriginal affairs from the 1980s onwards. The report showed that Roebourne (with a largely Aboriginal population of 1,200) had ratios of police to citizens that were five times that of towns in more settled parts of Western Australia.\r\nThe area is home to the Ngarluma people, but many Yindjibarndi and Banyjima people previously from outlying stations also live in the town.\r\nOn 21 December 2011, Roebourne set a new record for the highest maximum temperature recorded in the state during December. The temperature peaked at 49.4 °C (120.9 °F), beating the old record of 48.8 °C (119.8 °F) set at Mardie Station in 1986.[11] Roebourne and the Western Australian town of Carnarvon share the record for Australia\'s hottest March temperature of 47.8 °C (118.0 °F); it occurred in Roebourne on 4 March 1998 and in Carnarvon on 6 March 2007.[12]\r\nThe Government Resident, Robert John Sholl (1819–86), arrived in November 1865 [3] from the failed Camden Harbour settlement (near Kuri Bay) to provide assistance in developing the region and set up camp near the Withnells\' home while trying to find a suitable townsite. He eventually decided to locate the town at his camp, and on 17 August 1866, after surveyor Charles Wedge drew a draft plan consisting of 106 lots, Roebourne became the first gazetted town in the North West. It became the region\'s administrative centre and various government buildings, shops, services and hotels set up business. Sholl himself served as Justice of the Peace, district registrar and magistrate, and he was concerned with the plight of the local indigenous people and made submissions to the Government to ensure they had basic rights.[4]\r\nThe area was struck by another cyclone in 1925 that destroyed the Port Samson jetty and lifted the bridge to Pope\'s nose from the river bed. Several buildings were also destroyed with the town\'s residents seeking refuge in public brick buildings during the storm.[7]\r\nBy 1865, the population of the area had grown to about 200, and the Withnells\' property served as a local hub, with John Withnell opening a store and providing cartage services to the other settlers. Prior to the construction of a church in the area, services were held in their home.\r\nThe site of the Withnells\' house, which was rebuilt in 1937 by a later owner, is located on Hampton Street at the foot of Mount Welcome.[6]\r\nIn 1872, the town was destroyed by a cyclone.[5] Many of the buildings from shortly after this time are heritage listed. A number of the heritage buildings were the work of',0,-20.775420,117.146619),(14736,'Whim Creek','6718','West Pilbara','Western Australia - Outback (North)','WA','Not yet populated',0,-20.836800,117.838171),(14737,'Cossack','6720','West Pilbara','Western Australia - Outback (North)','WA','Former Post & Telegraph Office\r\nIn 1881 a cyclone damaged the town, and every pearling vessel then operating either foundered or was beached. In 1885, 44 vessels were operating out of Cossack. In that year a parliamentary select committee recommended the closure of several pearling banks in the area due to depletion. In 1886, the main pearling industry moved to Broome.[2][3]\r\nCossack, Customs House & Bond Store\r\nAround the turn of the century there were two hotels in Cossack: the Weld (named after the Governor) and the White Horse (opposite the wharf).[4]\r\nIn 1866 the town of Roebourne was declared, and the pearling industry began in the region. Cossack was the birthplace of Western Australia’s pearling industry and was the home of the colony’s pearling fleet until the 1880s. Many small boats off the Port Walcott coast dived for pearl shell during the 1860s using Aboriginal labour, including women and children. By early 1869, there were 14 small vessels pearling in the area, with an average crew of three Europeans and six Aboriginals. By the early 1870s up to 80 luggers were operating in the area. The pearling industry also attracted a large Asian population. By 1895, there were 989 Malays and 493 Aboriginals employed on 57 vessels at Cossack. The high number of Asians in the industry, including Japanese and Chinese as well as Malay, led to the establishment of an Asian quarter known as ‘Chinatown’.\r\nThe main stone buildings were constructed in the 1880s. Administrative and other public buildings built there in the 1890s continued a style adopted by the emerging state; these have been surveyed by state heritage groups and determined to be architecturally and historically significant.\r\nIn the 1920s there was still a Japanese shop in Cossack, run by pearling brothers Jiro and T. Muramats[4]\r\nThe main road from Roebourne to Cossack continues past the town of Wickham and the Cape Lambert iron ore port (operated by Pilbara Iron), and terminates at the fishing town of Point Samson. The townsite is not visible from the main road, and only becomes apparent as the road rounds Nanny Goat Hill.\r\nThe site of the former town is defined by Nanny Goat Hill, Tien Tsin Lookout, the hilly ground to the north-east and north-west, and Butchers Inlet to the east and south-east. Past the townsite, the road winds up to the Reader Head Lookout, from which sweeping views of the surrounding coastline can be seen. Many of the buildings are listed by the National Trust.\r\nCossack is an historic ghost town located 1,480 km north of Perth and 15 km from Roebourne in the Pilbara region of Western Australia. The nearest town to Cossack is Wickham.\r\nDuring the 1870s, a causeway was built across the tidal salt flats that separate Cossack from the main road. The causeway still forms the only access to the town from land.\r\nCossack, former Courthouse\r\nCossack, Former Galbraith\'s Store\r\nPolice lockup and ruins of toilet block (1897)\r\nCossack contains a small cemetery comprising separate European and Japanese precincts. The pearling industry of the 19th century was notably dangerous, with many pearlers losing their lives. Those buried in the Japanese cemetery were mainly divers and others involved with the pearling industry; others, including many Aborigines, were lost at sea. The first interment in the cemetery is believed to have taken place in 1869, when a man died while walking to Port Walcott in January and was buried there.[10]\r\nMedia related to Cossack, Western Australia at Wikimedia Commons\r\nCossack is located on Butchers Inlet at the mouth of the Harding River. It is reached by a single, sealed road that follows the original causeway across a series of tidal salt flats. The overall landform of the region around Cossack is a low, flat plain with occasional rocky hills and ranges. The vegetation is mainly grass, spinifex and low shrub, with occasional trees (mangroves) along watercourses and in gullies. The mangrove scrub becomes quite dense along the shoreline and at the mouth of the inlet.\r\nA horse-drawn tramway between Roebourne and Cossack was completed in 1887,[5][6] the same year that the municipality of Cossack was declared, and the north-west gold rush commenced.\r\nThe erstwhile Tien Tsin Harbour is now known as Port Walcott[1]\r\nIn May 1863, Walter Padbury landed his stock at the mouth of the Harding River near the present site of Cossack. Cossack was first known as Tien Tsin Harbour, after the barque that carried Padbury and his party. The ship that brought the state\'s Governor, Frederick Weld, in December 1871 was named HMS Cossack and the town adopted this name in 1872. Cossack was the first port in the North West, and was critical to the development of the pastoral industry in the region.\r\nFollowing the move of the pearling industry to Broome and the decline of the gold rush, the population of Cossack dwindled. The harbour proved unsuitable for the larger ships of the early 20th century.

The wet season features hot, humid days and nights and erratic downpours. Some years there is no wet season whatsoever, however in others more than a years worth of rain can fall in a month. Derby can be affected by severe tropical cyclones from time to time. The dry season lasts from April to November and features very little rain, warm to hot daytime temperatures and mild to cool nights. Extreme temperatures have ranged from 48.4 °C (119.1 °F) to 6.0 °C (42.8 °F), while the wettest month on record was January 1917 when 803.6 mm (31.64 in) of rain fell.\r\nIn 1968 the town had a population of approximately 1,500 many employed at the meatworks. A A$900,000 beef road from Glenroy Station to Derby was completed the same year to assist with the development of beef processing.

It is located about 1,186 kilometres (737 mi) north of Perth, and 9 kilometres (5.6 mi) north of the Tropic of Capricorn. It can be reached by the Great Northern Highway. In the 2011 Australian census, its population was 5,478.[4] Newman is a modern mining town, with homes contrasting with the surrounding reddish desert.\r\nNewman has an semi-arid climate, with very hot summers and mild winters. The temperature reaches or exceeds 38 °C (100 °F) for many days in the summer. On 15 January 1998, the temperature reached an all-time recorded high of 47 °C (117 °F).\r\nTypical of company towns, Newman is laid out with a core, where shopping and hotels are located, surrounded by residential areas, with more industrial activities on the outskirts. There is one shopping mall in the town, two shopping plazas, three hotels, and three bars/restaurants outside of those contained in the hotels. One public outdoor pool serves the town\'s population.\r\nMedia related to Newman, Western Australia at Wikimedia Commons\r\nThe town is served by Newman Airport.\r\nAboriginal occupation of the area extends to around 26,000 years. The Martu people comprise about a dozen language groups that extend across the Gibson and Great Sandy Deserts. The Martu progressively lost their land and nomadic lifestyle as European expansion crept inland from the late 19th Century. Western exploration, the establishment of Christian missions, and gold discoveries at Marble Bar and Wiluna led to Indigenous people moving from their traditional lands.\r\nNewman was established as Mount Newman by Mt. Newman Mining Co. Pty Ltd (a subsidiary of BHP) in 1966 as a company town to support the development of iron ore deposits at nearby Mount Whaleback.[5] The town takes its name from nearby Mount Newman, named in honour of government surveyor Aubrey Woodward Newman, who died of typhoid at Cue on 24 May 1896, while on an expedition from Nannine to the Ophthalmia Range. William Frederick Rudall then took charge of the expedition and named Mount Newman to honour his deceased leader.[6][7][8][9][10]\r\nThe ore trains are typically over 2 km long. Newman is also a service town to the nearby mining settlements like Tom Price and Paraburdoo.\r\nA privately owned railway, the Mount Newman railway, was constructed linking it to Port Hedland which itself was upgraded to handle shipment of the ore to the world market. On 21 June 2001 a train 7.353 km (4.569 mi) long, comprising 682 ore cars and eight locomotives made the Newman—Port Hedland trip and is listed as the world\'s longest ever train.[11][12]\r\nBeing founded in the 1960s, Newman\'s architecture reflects the modernist styles of that decade and the next, being predominantly functional and devoid of detail or embellishment. As the town was founded and built by a steel company, the majority of buildings use a steel frame construction. This applies to the homes themselves, most of them being two prefabricated halves inserted together into a steel I-section frame, the columns of which are left exposed on the exterior of the home. This construction method serves not only to showcase the company\'s product, but also gives strong resistance to cyclone winds which can affect the region from time to time. For this same reason most houses are elevated from the ground by a few steps.

The town set a world record of most consecutive days of 100 °F (37.8 °C) or above, during a period of 160 days from 31 October 1923 to 7 April 1924.[5] Although annual temperatures indicate Marble Bar to be within the tropics thanks due a July mean at 19 °C (66 °F), it is a long way off qualifying as a tropical climate, due to the high precipitation requirements for hot-weather climates to sustain tropical vegetation.\r\nDuring December and January, temperatures in excess of 45 °C (113 °F) are common, and the average maximum temperature exceeds normal human body temperature for 6 months each year. Marble Bar receives 159.6 clear days annually. Dewpoint in the summers is between 10 and 15 °C (50 and 59 °F). Rainfall is erratic and sparse, falling largely between December and April. As little as 71.1 mm (2.8 in) can fall in a year, however during heavy wet seasons when the monsoon reaches well south into the Pilbara, as much as 797.9 mm (31.4 in) can fall annually.

It is well known for its extremely hot weather.\r\nIn 1891 the town boasted a population in excess of 5,000 as it experienced a rush on the goldfields.[3]\r\nSeveral large gold nuggets were discovered as a result of the goldrush. The 333 ounce Little Hero nugget, the 413 ounce Bobby Dazzler and the 332 ounce General Gordon nugget were all found in the goldfields around the town.\r\nAn ironically named locality nearby is known as North Pole (21° 05\' S. 119° 22\' E.), no doubt for its heat. It is the location of rock formations considered to have evidence that puts the origin of life on earth back to 3,400–3,500 million years ago, due to stromatolites in particular rock sequences.[8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17] However this is disputed, and it is argued that stromatolites older than 3,200 mya are not the result of living organisms (the definition of stromatolites includes both living and abiotic causes), the small conical structures in the Strelley Pool formation (Warrawoona Group) being formed by evaporation and a dome structure from the North Pole chert (also Warrawoona Group) being formed by soft-sediment deformation.[18][19]\r\nThe town was officially gazetted in 1893 following the discovery of gold in the area in 1890 by a prospector named Francis Jenkins who is remembered by the name of the town\'s main street.[2] The name Marble Bar was derived from a nearby jasper bar mistaken for marble and now known as Marble Bar, which runs across the bed of the Coongan River.\r\nDuring World War II, United States Army Air Forces and Royal Australian Air Force heavy bombers were based 25 kilometres (16 mi) away as the crow flies at Corunna Downs Airfield. Allied airmen from the base attacked Japanese forces as far away as Borneo.\r\nIt had a railway connecting with Port Hedland up until the early 1950s, which can be seen as a narrow gauge precursor to the network of standard gauge iron-ore railways that have since been created across the Pilbara.\r\nPossibly the most famous building in the town is the Ironclad hotel built in the 1890s, constructed of corrugated Iron, and given the name by American miners who were reminded of the Ironclad ships from the United States.

In 1990, a merger between Newmont Australia Limited and BHP Gold Limited resulted in the creation of Newcrest Mining, with ownership of the Telfer Mine now lying with Newcrest.[8]\r\nTelfer is a minesite in the Pilbara region of Western Australia, within the Great Sandy Desert. Telfer was previously the state\'s most isolated town, located 1,300 kilometres (808 mi) north-east of the state capital Perth.[3] The gold and copper mine is run by Newcrest Mining, and is the second-largest gold mine in Australia.\r\nTelfer has a semi arid climate with extremely hot summers and warm winters. Summer highs average at 40 °C (104 °F) and winter highs at 25 °C (77 °F). It receives an average annual rainfall of approximately 370 millimetres (15 in), despite the fact that it lies relatively close to the Indian Ocean. This location leaves the community vulnerable to tropical cyclones. For example, Cyclone Graham affected the area in early 2003, delivering 163mm of rain. Severe Tropical Cyclone Laurence also passed over the mine site in December 2009.[12]\r\nNewmont Mining first made a claim to the deposit in 1972;[4] however, this is disputed by Jean-Paul Turcaud to this date.[5][6]\r\nIn 1996, the town suffered the decision to move the Telfer mine from residential to a fly-in fly-out workforce. Many of the commercial services were withdrawn; only the recreational facilities were maintained. The existing housing was now used for the accommodation of the mine\'s mobile work force. One of the main reasons for the town\'s closure was that fly-in fly-out rosters gave the mine access to a larger skilled work force and to people that would otherwise have been unwilling to relocate to a remote location like Telfer.[7]\r\nThe town of Telfer, non-existent until then, was built by Newmont in 1976 and named after A.H. Telfer, a former under secretary for mines in Western Australia. The town grew to a peak of almost 1,000 inhabitants in the early 1990s, with services like a supermarket, a police station, a bank, a community hall, a library and a number of sporting facilities being available.[7]\r\nOpen-cut mining was suspended in August 2000 due to high operating costs.

It proved an inhospitable land for these people and the graves of some can be found in Old Town\'s small cemetery. The gold rush lasted less than 3 months and Halls Creek became a trading centre for cattle stations, aboriginal communities and miners who stayed in the area. The post office with its telegraph line that terminated here, the police station, government office, racecourse and stores gave the town a purpose. In 1918 the Australian Inland Mission built a hospital and the old town struggled on, short of inhabitants and water. In 1948 an airfield was built near the site of the present town and over the next decade the old town moved nearer to this new site. Except for the police station, which finally relocated in 1961, the old town was abandoned by 1954.\r\nLate in the 19th Century, Europeans arrived, searching for land for cattle and sheep, as well as minerals.

A wood-based industrial park nearby was the subject of extensive community discussion but is now built and operating successfully. There have been several recent controversies over development in the region, particularly over logging at Recherche Bay and the development of a tourist resort inside the National Park at Cockle Creek.\r\nToday the Huon Valley is best known as one of Tasmania\'s primary apple growing areas. Once enormous in its extent, the significance of the industry has declined steadily since the 1950s and today cherries and fish farming are the rising commercial stars of the district.\r\nHuonville was not originally intended as the site of a town. Nearby Ranelagh was laid out as the town of Victoria in colonial days. Huonville grew around the bridge crossing the Huon River and hotels at the bridge. It was officially declared a town in 1891.[3]\r\nHuonville is a town on the Huon River, in the south-east of Tasmania, Australia. It is the seat of the Huon Valley Council area and lies 38 km south of Hobart on the Huon Highway. At the 2006 census, Huonville had a population of 1,806 and at the 2011 census had a population of 1,741.[2][1]\r\nThe first Europeans to set eyes on the Huon River were the crew commanded by Admiral Bruni d\'Entrecasteaux. The river was named by him in honour of his second in command, Captain Huon de Kermadec. The name is preserved today in many features: the town, the river, the district and so on.

The settlement Geeves set up was renamed Geeves Town in 1861, and the name eventually became Geeveston.[2] Geeveston is for local government purposes included in the area of the Huon Valley Council and is part of the division of Franklin for both Australian House of Representatives and Tasmanian House of Assembly electoral purposes.\r\nGeeveston is on the Huon Highway, and is the gateway to the Hartz Mountains National Park. It is the centre of Tasmania\'s apple and fruit-growing industry, and has also been highly reliant on the timber industry since the late 19th century. A pulp mill was opened in the town in 1962, and was Geeveston\'s largest employer until the plant closed in 1982, devastating the area economically.[3] The Forest & Heritage Centre, a tourist centre which details the history of the timber industry in the area, is located in Geeveston.\r\nGeeves-Town Post Office opened on 1 June 1876 and was renamed Geeveston in 1888.[4]\r\n',0,-43.164721,146.926948),(14975,'Police Point','7116','Huon - Bruny Island','South East','TAS','Not yet populated',0,-43.243825,147.045882),(14976,'Port Huon','7116','Huon - Bruny Island','South East','TAS','Not yet populated',0,-43.155399,146.963385),(14977,'Surges Bay','7116','Huon - Bruny Island','South East','TAS','Not yet populated',0,-43.218087,146.989745),(14978,'Surveyors Bay','7116','Huon - Bruny Island','South East','TAS','Not yet populated',0,-43.278540,147.085138),(14979,'Dover','7117','Huon - Bruny Island','South East','TAS','Not yet populated',0,-43.314133,147.015191),(14980,'Stonor','7119','Central Highlands (Tas.)','South East','TAS','Not yet populated',0,-42.397107,147.375552),(14981,'Andover','7120','North East','Launceston and North East','TAS','Not yet populated',0,-42.329996,147.460643),(14982,'Antill Ponds','7120','North East','Launceston and North East','TAS','Not yet populated',0,-42.204006,147.401352),(14983,'Baden','7120','North East','Launceston and North East','TAS','Not yet populated',0,-42.426554,147.467699),(14984,'Lemont','7120','North East','Launceston and North East','TAS','Not yet populated',0,-42.294582,147.619035),(14985,'Levendale','7120','North East','Launceston and North East','TAS','Not yet populated',0,-42.532725,147.582710),(14986,'Mount Seymour','7120','North East','Launceston and North East','TAS','Not yet populated',0,-42.401154,147.449881),(14987,'Oatlands','7120','North East','Launceston and North East','TAS','Not yet populated',0,-42.300296,147.370784),(14988,'Parattah','7120','North East','Launceston and North East','TAS','The railway in Parattah served as an important point on the Main line from Hobart to Launceston, being the halfway stopping point for the Tasman Limited, and the terminus for suburban and inter-regional passenger services on the Tasmanian Government Railways. Within the timetables, Parattah was allocated as a station where refreshments could be purchased, or where train, taxi or airplane connections could be arranged.[6] Because of the high volume of traffic the station received, it was the location of a coaling stage and water refilling station for steam locomotives, a wye for turning locomotives around, as well as sidings and a loading crane for freight and goods traffic. Whilst not a part of the system nowadays, the sidings and loading crane can still be seen today.\r\nThe area is home to about 100 families, and contains many historic buildings, such as a farmhouse which was once home to Hudson Fysh, one of the founders of Qantas, and a historic railway station. The main street contains a number of attractive dwellings dating from the town\'s heyday, some of which are currently undergoing restoration. The village retains the original general store, the impressive Tudor style \'Parattah Hotel\' and a number of historic churches.\r\nParattah is a small township in Tasmania, located approximately 6 kilometres (4 mi) southeast of the town of Oatlands. At the 2011 census, Parattah had a population of 360.[1]\r\nParattah was once known as Parattah Junction due to the former Oatlands Railway, which branched off towards Oatlands from this area. Today, the railway station serves no passenger traffic, with the last passenger visits occurring in the early 2000s on heritage rail tours.\r\nThe first post office serving the township opened 1 June 1879 and was originally named \'Oatlands Station\' until it was renamed Parattah with effect from 1 January 1882. It was located at the railway station (which, while at Parattah, was actually the official Station for Oatlands) until 8 January 1914.[2][3] The postmistress from 1946 to 1966 was Mrs. Mary Fisher. She was succeeded by her daughter, Miss Vera Fisher, who retired in March 1977 and who has been claimed to be an ancestor of the postal reformer Sir Rowland Hill.[4] The town also has a public telephone, which was removed in July 2009, but after much local outcry, was restored one month later.[5]\r\nThe station building itself has been restored, with a small museum housed there, and is now situated beside a public picnic reserve.

Reed conducted some early Wesleyan services in his home on the property known as Wesley Dale. He donated the land for the Wesleyan church with the intention that, when it was built, it was to initially be used as a school.[4] The first official Wesleyan services began c.1875 in a private home[5] that was sited in a paddock, near the bridge over Lobster creek.[4] Caveside Wesleyan church, and an associated cottage, was built and completed in 1876.[6] In 1903 the church became the Caveside Methodist church.[5] It was replaced with a brick church in 1978,[7] that is no longer open or used for church services.[note 1]\r\nCaveside had a post office from 1887 operating from a private home.[8] It opened on the 1st of November and finally closed in 1980.[9] A private school opened, in the Wesleyan church, in Caveside on 4 June 1877 with 27 students. A single-room school building, and associated teacher\'s residence, was constructed over 1892–93. The school remained[note 2] in this building until 1937 when the school was closed. The school building was moved to Mole Creek in 1938 and used for \'domestic arts\' at the Mole Creek district area school.[3]\r\nIt is a small community within an agricultural area, rather than a town. The town lies in an area of limestone; erosion of this has led to the surrounding land being riddled with caves. To the west are two undeveloped cave complexes, Wet Caves and Honeycomb Caves,[2] which are an attraction to cavers. The ground is pitted with sinkholes, a danger to the cattle that graze the fields. The district is probably named after the caves, though until 1897 it was known as Brookside.[3] Prior to settlement what is now developed agricultural land was dense forest. The timber and dairy industries are prominent parts of Caveside\'s rural history and it was known in the early 20th century for the quality of its cattle and sheep studs.[4]\r\nAdditional buildings were constructed on the Methodist church\'s land. These buildings included a cottage and two buildings used as a shop and a post office.[4] The shop and post office buildings were rented out from c.1900 to c.1940. A hall, noted for its fine timber lining, was built in 1921.[5] A public swimming pool, built with local volunteer labour, opened in 1957. It was extended in 1980 with the addition of a tennis court and in 2001 when gas barbeques were added.[note 3] The pool is a 16-metre (52 ft) outdoor pool and is managed by the Caveside Recreation Committee.[10] The shop has long closed but the Caveside memorial hall remains open and is operated by the Meander Valley Council.[11] The Church of Christ formed an organisation in the area in 1909. Prior to this services had been held in Caveside. They built a hand-split timber church building and opened it in 1911. The original building was moved in 1956 and a replacement built.[7] The building is now known as \"The Church in the Paddock\"\"\"\".[12]\"\"\"',0,-41.595636,146.432449),(15358,'Central Plateau','7304','Meander Valley -

Ulverstone','West and North West','TAS','Turners Beach was originally known as Scott’s Beach, named after the Scott family who operated a flour mill on Claytons Rivulet. .[6]\r\nTurners Beach is a small town on the north coast of Tasmania. Almost equidistant between the cities of Devonport and Ulverstone, it is at the western mouth into Bass Strait of the Forth River, opposite the village of Leith on its eastern mouth. Its population as at 2011 was 1595 people.[1]\r\nThere used to be two small supermarkets in the town one each end of the Esplanade. The one at the top of the Esplanade closed and the other is now a café providore.\r\nIts post office opened on 15 December 1956.[5]\r\nThe Turners Beach Cricket Club compete in the Mersey Valley Cricket Association.\r\nThe Gables an early residential house was built around 1850 and was originally known as The Sailors Return Inn. Although the building only operated as a hotel for a decade (it was delicensed in 1860) it had a short and colourful history. In 1853 it was robbed by the bushrangers Dalton and Kelly (not Ned) who stole the landlord\'s whale boat and sailed across the Bass Strait to Victoria. They were subsequently caught, brought back to Tasmania and executed in Launceston.[4]\r\nTurners Beach Tennis Club is affiliated with Tennis North West.\r\nThere used to be two caravan parks to cater for the summer holiday makers. One has since closed and was redeveloped for residential buildings.\r\nMedia related to Turners Beach, Tasmania at Wikimedia Commons\r\nThe Turners Beach Football Club compete in the North Western Football Association.\r\nThe 1st Turners Beach Scouts part of the Leven District Scouting Association operate out of the local hall on the Esplanade.\r\nA Growers and Makers Market at Turners Beach, a Twilight Market featuring local producers and artisans with a community focus is held the last Sunday of every month.\r\nFor many decades there was a garden nursery operating in Forth Road.\r\nA cairn recording the location of the first European settlement of the area in 1840 by James Fenton (1820–1901)[2] is situated 100 metres from Forth Bridge in Turners Beach and was also the site of the pioneer and historian\'s house.[3]\r\nTurners Beach Bowls Club have Men\'s and Women\'s Pennants as well as social bowls.\r\nThe mouth of the Forth River is at one end of the beach and has been treacherous to surfers. The Forth River used to be plentiful with Cocky Salmon. At the other end of the beach is Claytons Rivulet known to contain platypus, eels and brown trout.\r\nA service station and takeaway exists on Forth Road.\r\nThe tide goes out a fair distance and at times there was an annual beach sprint on the hard sand. The rolling waves produce a very fine white sand which is less course than that of Ulverstone.\r\nThe township of Turners Beach was developed by and renamed in honour of Harry Vincent Glengyle (Glen) Turner on 21 March 1961 who was on the Ulverstone Council and Town Planning Committee at the time.[7]\r\nThe Turner Beach Volunteer Fire Brigade has its base in Turners Avenue and had a siren that could be heard all over town.',0,-41.157532,146.247149),(15457,'Ulverstone','7315','Burnie -
